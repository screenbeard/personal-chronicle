}I just nominated someone for a Wave account and they received it within
thirty minutes. That and the number of invites I last received (30) lead
me to think that Wave accounts are no longer the hard-to-get commodity
they once were.

Oh well, no more [\$100
invites](http://mashable.com/2009/09/30/google-wave-invite/) on eBay.
