and animator.

I was catching up on my [Channel
Frederator](http://channelfrederator.com "The Original Cartoon Podcast")
(now only 11 weeks behind), and was thrilled by the simplicity and
elegance of their 100th cartoon short - *An eye for Annai*[]() ([Episode
26](http://www.channelfrederator.com/frederator/episode/CFR_20060418 "Episode 26 of Channel Frederator")).*\

This beautiful film is the story of little one-eyed Annai, a little
fellow who's on the hunt for a second eye. His journey takes him from
tall mountains to the depths of the sea (look out for a tiny recorder
rendition of the *Imperial March* - Darth Vader's theme). How Jon has
managed to pour so much expression into a creature with only an eye and
a mouth is wonderful to watch.

This is animated film like it should be.

So I checked out his site (above) and found a lot of his work to be just
as simply beautiful as *[An Eye for
Annai](http://burstofbeaden.com/aneyeforannai.html "An Eye for Annai")*.
He's put a widescreen version of the short on
[Putfile](http://media.putfile.com/An-Eye-For-Annai "Putfile - An Eye for Annai").
Check it.
