**The Jones-spectre disappeared and the planet erupted in flame.**

Rex watched horrified as people burned. But the burning did not consume
them. People who were alive moments before were on fire - how had they
survived this?

The fire ceased after an eternity. Months had passed and the agony was
over, the people unaffected by it. The star's energy receded back into
its gravity well and the horror and pain became fear and trepidation.

And Jones appeared again and whispered what he would do if the people
continued to defy him.

He would destroy their star with a thought and keep them alive to watch.
