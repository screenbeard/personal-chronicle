An example of my proposal

I don't want a separate app where I have to gather all my friends and
influencers in one place all over again - I have that in Twitter.

What I want from you is a way to flag a user (secretly) as someone whose
opinion has aligned with mine in the past, so that when they say "I love
this new movie", I'll be reasonably certain that I will too. And if I
could flag someone's opinion as wrong((that's what we're all thinking
right?)) most of the time, then I will know that when they say "I love
this song", not to bother clicking through to it. It might mean that
some of the users in my stream have slightly darker or lighter updates
so I can tell at a glance which ones I've flagged as trustworthy or
mostly wrong.

Heck, just being able to easily see that someone is in a "trusted"
private Twitter list with a glance at my main stream would be double
handy. Do that.

Thank you for listening. If you do this, you will win the world.

PS. to all the people I follow: I'm not talking about any of you. I
think all of you have fantastic taste. It's those other people I worry
about...
