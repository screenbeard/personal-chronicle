}**Rex turned quickly on his heel**

"Aha"

Rex strained to see the other, now he was back in the real world but it
was proving tricky. Back in the other realm, the presence was there,
like a change in pressure - feel-able if not physical - and somehow
natural. Here on the cliff, the cold wind in his hair and sunshine on
his face, the constant nearness of his non-physical companion felt
unnerving. Rex wondered if this was what it felt like to be haunted.

"Can you stay still so I can finally get a look at you?" he demanded of
the other.

% \[voiceinthedark\]I assure you I am quite still,\[/voiceinthedark\]
the voice replied, \[voiceinthedark\]but I understand your discomfort.
Allow me to make myself physical.\[/voiceinthedark\]%

Rex waited.

A figure solidified before him.

"You're not who I expected," said Rex.
