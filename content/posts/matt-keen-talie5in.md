}Matt is a fellow school support officer, doing ICT at another large
metropolitan high school. He's highly qualified and extremely
knowledgeable, and a huge Microsoft fanboy. He's my first port of call
for questions about Windows Server and Active Directory, as I know he's
always on top of the latest information from Redmond.

Commander Keen also has an iPhone fetish. For months he paid me out
about mine, but it turns out he really **was** just jealous. So now he
has one of those fancy ones that does video and your taxes. They are
pretty neat I guess.

He looks out for his friends and is willing to drop everything to help
out a mate. He's a prolific poster on the ICT help forum and email lists
we have in the department, and his answers are **actually helpful** ((I
know!)). Since he joined Twitter, I've discovered he knows half the
geeks in Adelaide already.

So if you want to follow someone who really knows their tech, Microsoft
((and now Apple)), Open Source, and other geeky stuff and is super
friendly and a good mate of mine â€” hit up
