> First, the extension installer gives you an option in your New Wave

> surprises await). Then, whenever a user types ‘trick or treat’, the
> robot fetches an image from Google Image Search for either a yummy
> candy bar, or well, something not that yummy.

No one I know has ever celebrated Halloween (it’s relatively new in
Australia), and I say “Bah humbug!” (wrong holiday I know). But for
those of you who want to get into the spirit of it (bad pun I know), but
don’t want to leave Wave, this might be for you.
