**The Professor awoke to a hole where his lab should have been.**

And no eyebrows.

For a few moments he sat dazed against the corridor wall where, if the pain in his head was anything to go by, he'd been tossed when his lab had been destroyed.

While he waited for the ringing in his ears to subside, he tried to figure out what had happened. Could it be sabotage? What else might explode?

He wondered if it had been something he'd been working on, but try as he might, he could not recall the last thing he'd been doing. In fact, he found he was having trouble recalling anything at all.

The last thing he could remember was... witnessing a spacetime anomaly with Rex, just before Rex's big Sheebat game.

That was it. That was the last thing he could remember. Looking up his records of the anomaly he was shocked to discover three months had passed since then.

Had the anomaly done this then?

What in space was going on?
