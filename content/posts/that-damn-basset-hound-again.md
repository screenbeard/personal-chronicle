I just got my first actual real life death threat in a comment on my
[oh-so-stupid-I-wish-I-hadn't-written-it Fred Basset
post](//the.geekorium.com.au/why-fred-basset-is-the-dumbest-comic-strip-ever/).
It was a dumb post I wrote back when I was desperate for stuff to write
about, and I regret writing it so poorly. While I stand by the basic
sentiment - so I won't delete it - it reads like it was written by a
Youtube commenter and makes me cringe knowing that it's cluttering up my
site.

The worst part about it is the post accounts for about 3% of my search
traffic and 3% of the comments I get. That doesn't sound like much, but
most of the other stuff I write doesn't get nearly the same amount of
interaction. And I still get comments on it now, about a 50/50 split of
agreement and disagreement - it was *highly controversial* obviously.

And today I got another comment ending with the following death threat:

> DO NOT mess with bassets again, or i will have to kill you. ruby

Of course, this chills me to my core, but I believe so strongly how bad
Fred Basset is, that I *will not be frightened into submission*.

Sorry Ruby, I won't be publishing your comments, nor that of the *other*
person who left a comment. I just don't *care* enough. I have other
things I've written that are more important to me. Things about my [life
and family](//the.geekorium.com.au/category/blog/life/), or my [ongoing
sci-fi serial about Rex
Havoc](//the.geekorium.com.au/category/space-flight-704/) that's at
*least* as funny as Fred Basset.

What I'm trying to say is, I want to put Fred Basset to bed please. If
you love him, that's great. *Have a great time!* Why my opinion matters
to you I cannot fathom. Just enjoy yourself.

And don't threaten me.
