Here's my favourite pancake recipe. It's excellent with some good quality yoghurt and fruit instead of maple syrup.

<div class="hrecipe"><h4 class="fn">Recipe: Oat Pancakes</h4>
<p class="summary"><strong>Summary</strong>: <em>These pancakes are tasty and healthy</em></p>
<div class="ingredients">
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul class="ingredients">
    <li class="ingredient">1 cup rolled oats</li>
    <li class="ingredient">1 cup milk</li>
    <li class="ingredient">1 egg</li>
    <li class="ingredient">1 tbsp sugar</li>
    <li class="ingredient">3/4 cup wholemeal self-raising flour</li>
    <li class="ingredient">30 grams (1 1/2 tbsp) butter/marg</li>
    <li class="ingredient">Pinch of salt</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="instructions"><h4>Instructions</h4><ol class="instructions">
    <li>In a medium bowl mix oats, milk, sugar and egg. If you do this a while before the rest of the recipe, the oats get so soft it's like eating air.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl pour self raising flour and a pinch of salt.</li>
    <li>Melt butter</li>
    <li>Pour wet ingredients into flour and mix well.</li>
    <li>Heat a small non-stick pan on the lowest heat.</li>
    <li>When hot, pour a serving-spoon or two of pancake mixture. Swirl pan to make even round pancakes.</li>
    <li>The pancake will cook slowly. When the top starts to bubble, flip the pancake over.</li>
    <li>Serve with yoghurt for a healthy alternative to syrup.</li></ol></div>
<div class="quicknotes"><h4>Quick Notes</h4><p class="quicknotes">It's vitally important that you have patience with pancakes. Don't put the heat up too high! The slower you cook them, the fluffier and lighter they will be.
These pancakes seem like they will be bitty, but have faith - they are as soft and smooth as any other, more so! And they taste divine.</p></div><p class="duration"><span class="hrlabel">Cooking time (duration): </span><span class="hritem">15</span></p><p class="yield"><span class="hrlabel">Number of servings (yield): </span><span class="hritem">4</span></p><p class="mealtype"><span class="hrlabel">Meal type: </span><span class="hritem">breakfast</span></p><p class="myrating">My rating: <span class="rating">5</span> stars:&nbsp;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</p>Microformatting by <a href="http://website-in-a-weekend.net/hrecipe/" target="_blank">hRecipe</a>.<br /></div>

I've worked out the Calorie count for these pancakes. 

- If you use 1/5th the mixture per pancake, you're eating roughly 890kJ or 215Cal. 
- If like me you add 2 tbsp it's only an extra 10Cal per pancake. 
- A 1/4 cup of choc-chips adds an extra 100Cal to each pancake.
