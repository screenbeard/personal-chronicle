Here's my favourite pancake recipe. It's excellent with some good
quality yoghurt and fruit instead of maple syrup.

Instructions

1.  In a medium bowl mix oats, milk, sugar and egg. If you do this a
    while before the rest of the recipe, the oats get so soft it's like
    eating air.

2.  In a large bowl pour self raising flour and a pinch of salt.

3.  Melt butter

4.  Pour wet ingredients into flour and mix well.

5.  Heat a small non-stick pan on the lowest heat.

6.  When hot, pour a serving-spoon or two of pancake mixture. Swirl pan
    to make even round pancakes.

7.  The pancake will cook slowly. When the top starts to bubble, flip
    the pancake over.

8.  Serve with yoghurt for a healthy alternative to syrup.

Quick Notes

It's vitally important that you have patience with pancakes. Don't put
the heat up too high! The slower you cook them, the fluffier and lighter
they will be.\
These pancakes seem like they will be bitty, but have faith - they are
as soft and smooth as any other, more so! And they taste divine.

I've worked out the Calorie count for these pancakes. If you use 1/5th
the mixture per pancake, you're eating roughly 890kJ or 215Cal. If like
me you add 2 tbsp it's only an extra 10Cal per pancake. A 1/4 cup of
choc-chips adds an extra 100Cal to each pancake.
