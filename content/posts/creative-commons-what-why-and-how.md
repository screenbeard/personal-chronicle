I've used this plugin here and elsewhere to add a Creative Commons
licence to the items I publish. Publishing something as Creative Commons
means you still retain full copyright to the material, but gives others
permission to use portions (or all) of your work on their own sites as
long as they meet your guidelines. The choices can be a combination of
the following:

-   Attribution - the person who uses your content must link back
    to you.
-   Non-commercial - the work they do must not be used for
    commercial gain.
-   Share Alike - the work they make must also be put under a Creative
    Commons licence with the same terms.

The nature of the web is to share and republish things you find
interesting and useful and to add your own take on it. By making my
writing CC licensed, people can share what I write without fear of
copyright claims (as long as they agree to my terms). I in turn other
people's CC licensed photos in a lot of my posts. CC helps to make the
web richer and more useful by opening up things that might otherwise be
locked away on their own sites.

If you don't plan to sell your work or make money off it, or feel like
contributing to your community in some way consider putting your work
under a Creative Commons licence.
