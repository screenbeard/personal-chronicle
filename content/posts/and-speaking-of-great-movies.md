}I saw *Kung-Fu Hussle* on the weekend. It was tops.

It was a lot of good fun. Don't see it expecting your life to be
changed, see it to laugh. See it to watch groups of people fighting in
totally improbable ways. Watch it to pick out the references to other
movies. I think the eastern superhero is growing on me.

The western superhero has a scientific origin. Superman is an alien, the
Green Lantern has a device, Spider-Man was bitten by a modified spider -
all very clear-cut scientifically explainable origins. The eastern
heroes on the other hand all have the same origins. The power comes from
within. Each character has a special power just like our western heroes,
but it is a manifestation of their inner power and their training. So
one character may have the power of the wind, or the power of a
particular animal. They're just like our heroes, but with very different
back-stories.

So check out *Kung-Fu Hussle* if you're in need of a superhero fix
before the release of *Spider-Man 3* next year, or are lonely for *The
Matrix*, or just need something to see next Friday night.
