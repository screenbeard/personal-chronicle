Ok, I'm sitting at home, feeling pretty tired, run down and fairly
unhappy. A [blog I'm
reading](http://www.bogglethemind.com/index.php?itemid=29 "Boggle the Mind's mention of iTunes")
mentions iTunes, and I fire it up to listen to some cheery music. While
I'm there I try for the millionth time to find a copy of "Come On a My
House" a remix of a Rosemary Clooney song by Nasty Tales which I first
heard on [Triple J
radio](http://triplej.net.au/ "Triple J youth radio station").

I searched a bit, and the Nasty Tales web site I found had a sample that
didn't sound right. I thought it might have been the version on the
Ursadelica - Ursula 1000 album, but wasn't certain.

Anyway, I LOVED it when I heard it, but I couldn't purchase it on
iTunes, which is my preferred method. For weeks I've tried, but to no
avail. But then today - a miracle - it's there. Not quite the version I
was looking for, as I think I was looking for the wrong one, but I think
it might actually be the one that Triple J played those weeks ago. SO
YAY! I'm a lot happier now.

it NOW if you have iTunes. I promise that the 1.69AUD that you'll pay
will be worth it. It's noisy and fun and happy. Cheer yourself up. Tell
me what you thought.
