I was tempted to do a “clip show” thing to refresh readers of the
important plot points that have happened so far. Fortunately for you, I
can’t imagine how to make something like that work in text, and still be
fun to read. So what follows is a basic recap of the story so far, as
simply as possible.

**WARNING:** this post contains spoilers for the Rex Havoc: Space Flight
704 story. If you ever plan to read it, I suggest you [head there
now](//the.geekorium.com.au/category/space-flight-704/) and get reading.
Or bookmark it… You know, whatever.

I’m posting this for the fans who haven’t had a Rex Havoc story for
almost a year. The last update to the major story-arc was on May 20
2012, which is a long time to remember things. I’ll try to include links
the pertinent chapters if you’d like to remember the specifics. This
also means I have more Rex on the way for you, and we’re in the home
stretch!

Our Hero.

Rex Havoc is a space adventurer. He does the difficult things no one
else can.

On a mission to secure the Ortrix, [Rex is betrayed by his partner,
Jones](//the.geekorium.com.au/space-flight-704-chapter-1-straight-to-the-hell-planet/).
[Rex barely escapes with his
life](//the.geekorium.com.au/space-flight-704-chapter-6-escape-from-the-hell-planet/)
after killing Jones and abandoning the mission.

Returning to base, Rex finds it totally destroyed and his good friend
and gadget maker, [The Professor,
dead](//the.geekorium.com.au/space-flight-704-chapter-7-the-ruins-of-xarnash/).
In a surprising turn of events - this early in the story - [Rex is
killed
too](//the.geekorium.com.au/space-flight-704-chapter-9-xarnash-destroyed/).

But not for long.

[Becoming conscious in an empty
mindscape](//the.geekorium.com.au/space-flight-704-chapter-10-new-flight/),
[Rex meets the
other](//the.geekorium.com.au/space-flight-704-chapter-11-the-voice-in-the-light/),
a mysterious, strangely familiar yet wholly otherworldly entity who
[teaches him about his new
existence](//the.geekorium.com.au/space-flight-704-chapter-13-confusion-is-a-stranger-in-bed/).

The Ortrix was more powerful than Jones let on, and [has made Rex a
powerful god-like
being](//the.geekorium.com.au/space-flight-704-chapter-21-doom-is-overrated/)
who can [shape the universe to his
will](//the.geekorium.com.au/space-flight-704-chapter-25-understand-the-rock/).

Rex learns the downside of so much power is [a conscience that cannot
stand to harm anything in the
universe](//the.geekorium.com.au/space-flight-704-chapter-26-deadly-knowledge/).
He also learns that Jones didn’t die and [also shares his power, without
his
conscience](//the.geekorium.com.au/space-flight-704-chapter-27-judas-kiss/).

[Confrontation is out of the
question](//the.geekorium.com.au/space-flight-704-chapter-28-not-for-the-faint-of-heart/).
[Jones can inflict a multitude of tortures on
Rex](//the.geekorium.com.au/space-flight-704-chapter-39-nowhere-to-run/)
