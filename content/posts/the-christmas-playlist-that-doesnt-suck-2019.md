I've scoured Soundcloud to find the best Christmas music I could find. It's chock full of Christmas favourites that are guaranteed to:

1.  Bring Christmas cheer
2.  Not suck

This years playlist includes:

Many originals and covers of well known Christmas songs such as 'Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)', 'O Come All Ye Faithful', 'Joy To The World', 'We Wish You A Merry Christmas', 'Up On The Housetop', 'Auld Lang Syne', 'Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas', and many more reimagined in ways that don't suck.
