title: It's Easter. So Chill Out, Try Wave, Check out Mr-Ray and Say Hello!

In honour of a couple of Wave extensions that allow wave-to-email
collaboration, I thought I'd try something light-hearted instead of my
usual wordy post. Mr-Ray is a bot/gadget combo from
[wave.to](http://wave.to), that lets you add people to a wave by their
email address, and they get sent a stripped back version of the wave
that they can use to collaborate with you, without having to figure out
and navigate the full-blown Wave interface. Embedded below is an example
of the interface the email user sees. **Please note**, this isn't the
way the developers recommend using Mr-Ray - the address should be kept
secret to avoid people posing as you. In this case, I KNOW it's not me!

I've got a short holiday thanks to Easter, so I'll leave this up until
Wednesday to get to know my readers and give the non-wavers a chance to
see a little bit how it works. I'll check back regularly to reply so you
come back too! If you're already on wave and want to reply as you,
contact me at nunn.joshua@googlewave.com and I'll add you directly.

\[ This used to be an embedded view of a Wave. Technology comes and goes
and we lose even the archives of what we had. \]\

Updated: Added static view of the wave for reference.
