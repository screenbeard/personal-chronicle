As a general rule, I don't discuss dreams. Yes, it might have been
exciting. No, I don't think it would make a good plot for the next Star
Trek movie. Your dreams mostly star Amanda Tapping for one thing.

So normally I wont tell you the boring details of *my* dreams, for fear
of having you reciprocate. But last night I had my third lucid dreaming
experience and it was **very** fun.

[Lucid
dreaming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dreaming "Wikipedia entry on lucid dreaming")
is when you are able to recognise when you are dreaming and can take
control of that dream in some way ((Although sometimes I wonder if I'm
just dreaming that I know that I'm dreaming...)). They say that to lucid
dream, you have to recognise you're in a dream somehow.

Well last night, as I raced my office chair down a hill, I hit a bump
that launched me high into the air. As I fell, I recognised that I'd
been in situations like this before and I usually wake up very soon.
This time, instead of crashing - I flew. Like [Nathan
Petrelli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Petrelli "Wikipedia entry on Heroes character Nathan Petrelli")
from Heroes. And I could fly wherever I liked.

I woke up then - stupid dead arm - so I never got much further than
that, buy boy was it fun while it lasted. I woke up grinning!

I don't think I can strictly call it lucid dreaming yet - as I only ever
fly, and I always wake up very soon after I start. But before those
seconds are up, the feeling of freedom and control is amazing. Now I'm
off to re-read [how to lucid
dream](http://www.wikihow.com/Lucid-Dream "Wikihow entry on lucid dreaming").
