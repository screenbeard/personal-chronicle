Google Wave won’t run in Internet Explorer.

> Google Wave depends on strong JS and DOM rendering performance to
> provide a desktop-like experience in the browser. HTML5’s offline
> storage and web workers will enable us to add great features without
> having to compromise on performance. Unfortunately, Internet Explorer,
> still used by the majority of the Web’s users, has not kept up with
> such fairly recent developments in Web technology
