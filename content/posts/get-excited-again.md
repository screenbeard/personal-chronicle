Since my [last
post](//the.geekorium.com.au/google-wave-live-and-available-for-everyone-including-google-apps-users/)
more than a year ago, a lot has happened to Google Wave. Within months
of opening Wave up to everyone at the Google I/O conference, Google
pulled the plug, and Wave gurgled down the drain.

That left me feeling somewhat foolish, as I'd dedicated a good portion
of my time to Wave: joining a group of Wave Watchers((a group dedicated
to helping new wave users and maintaining some sense of order in the fun
chaos that was Wave)) and maintaining this website. I never expected
Wave to gather much support at first, but I honestly thought it would
last longer than it did. It certainly seemed to me to have more momentum
than it turned out to have.

So when I heard they were killing it off, I was left figuring out what
to do with this website. I had a couple of ideas:

1.  I thought I could change focus onto some other Google product, but
    honestly, none of them inspired me all that much: Buzz was a fairly
    bland FriendFeed clone that I couldn't use from my normal account
    and messed up my Google Reader experience.
2.  I could shift focus to a non-google product, but similarly, there
    was nothing all that awesome that I thought had much weight
    behind it. For instance, Novell's Pulse was meant to be a Wave-like
    collaboration tool that was intended to federate with Google Wave
    itself - but Novell the company just doesn't have the clout they
    used to have, and I knew Pulse wasn't really going to take off.
    There are so many products out there that do much the same sort of
    thing, but they're all these little walled-off social
    network wannabes.
3.  I could continue with the open-source Wave project picked up
    by Apache. A few people are running with this, and it might be a fun
    project to monitor but it's not moving as swiftly now that Google
    isn't funding it.
4.  I could generalise the focus to any product that might replace email
    as the fundamental communication of the internet. This would leave
    Facebook and Twitter and other Buzz-like products. This honestly
    appealed to me the most, but again the problem with most of these
    sorts of products is that they all live in their own little worlds
    and if I choose to use on Twitter for example, then I'm cut off from
    my wife who might choose to use Facebook.

So I thought about it and then just ignored the problem and hoped it
would go away. Plus I started a new job that required a lot of time and
energy and in the end, maintaining a website about a product or products
that didn't inspire me just... didn't inspire me.

But a few days ago, Google announced
[Google+](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/introducing-google-project-real-life.html)
(pronounced Google Plus if you couldn't figure that out). It's a "social
networking layer" built over the top of some of their other products. It
has some of the limitations of the products I decided not to focus on
from the list above, but it's got some promise and for the first time in
a year, I'm excited about one of Google's new products again.

So this site will now focus on Google+ for a while - until it takes off,
or fails. My next post will explain why I'm excited by this, and why I'm
writing about it when at first glance it seems no different to the
products on the list. I'm also planning a newbie's guide to bring
non-techies up to date.

If you're new here subscribe to the site! And if you're a reader from
long ago and my site's just popped up again in your Reader, then Hi!
Welcome Back! Thanks for sticking with me so long! Things are gonna ramp
up around here!
