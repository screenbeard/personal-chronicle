Why are websites by crazy people so damn ugly? So many websites about
conspiracies and aliens are just shockingly ugly to look at. Like [2012
Unlimited](http://www.2012.com.au), or the previously mentioned [David
Icke](http://www.davidicke.com/). I couldn't find it, but there is
another website that watches the movements of the Lizard Men... Damn
appalling website design.

Maybe these people aren't very good at graphic design. Personally, I
understand (templates for me baby), but why not just rip off someone
else's design like the rest of the Internet world? It's not helping you
seem believable when your site looks worse than sites I created in 1995.
Use some CSS, ditch that appalling repeating background squiggle. Stop
listing your content centred down the screen in bright orange fonts. And
please stop turning whole paragraphs into links!

Look, it's hard enough to be taken seriously these days, when anyone can
publish their opinions about any old crap, but to throw away what tiny
amount of credibility you have for the sake of keeping a few animated
GIFs is suicide.

Please, hire a designer. Take a class. Read a book. Look at other
websites. Make your websites prettier... Or I won't read them any more.
