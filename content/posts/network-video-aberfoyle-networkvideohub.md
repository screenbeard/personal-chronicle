}As of posting, @networkvideohub hasn't tweeted. I'm hoping that will
change soon!

Today's follow recommendation was a last minute ring-in. On a whim I
suggested to Scott Thomas, the manager of Aberfoyle Park's Network
Video, that they should start a Twitter account, and he sounded keen. I
thought it'd be neat to be able to tweet movie recommendations, check
whether videos are in stock and generally interact with the staff there,
who are all **so nice**.

The staff there have taken the time to learn my name, and give me
recommendations when I go in of videos that I might like, having learned
the type of videos that Camilla refuses to watch. And the Scott has very
good taste in movies too, which is a good thing for a movie store
manager. The other week I asked about the IT Crowd, and Ryan ((another
Beard Buddy!)) immediately hopped online and ordered it. That's service.

They haven't got a website for me to link to unfortunately ((although I
did find this article proving that [Scott Thomas is a local Aberfoyle
hero](http://hills-and-valley-messenger.whereilive.com.au/news/story/aberfoyle-post-office-to-return/))),
so their Twitter account will have to do. Follow
[@networkvideohub](http://twitter.com/networkvideohub) if you want to
support a local Adelaide business who's trying something new. Follow
them for information on the latest movie releases, movie recommendations
and because the staff there are friendly and know videos.
