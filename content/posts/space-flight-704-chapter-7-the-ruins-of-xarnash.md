}**The Professor was dead.**

He'd overturned the smoking ruins of his base to find his friend, the
quickly cooling body faint on his bio-scans. Obviously he had not been
complicit in Jones' treachery.

The base and his friendship with The Professor were his final bastion of
normalcy after his disastrous last mission, but even that was denied
him, another certainty cruelly ripped away by Jones. He wished he could
return to put another clip of bullets into his corpse.

Lying in the dirt and rubble, he held The Professor's body to him.

"When did the world go mad, old friend?" he whispered as the sun set
behind them.
