I've switched web hosts. This might not mean much to some, but it means
a better, easier experience for me. What it does mean though, is that I
had the opportunity to switch from one blogging program to another.
However they are two entirely different beasts, and I'm manually moving
most of my old posts to this new system.

So there will be a small transition phase. I'll get the bulk of the
comments over to this system too.

I still have my
[GodBlog](//the.geekorium.com.au/religion/ "Religion category on The Geekorium"),
my regular blog, my [dad's
blog](http://col.nunnone.com "Life and Times of Col Nunn") will be back
shortly and very soon I'll be launching my archive of how-to documents
that I've created in the course of my work. Check it all out!
