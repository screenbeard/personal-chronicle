Quickie:

-   Last class was useless, as I forgot my USB with my current work on
    it so I couldn't actually use the time to keep working on
    my assignment.

-   I got the assignment written and handed up, but I wasn't happy
    with it. I have the control stuff sorted (*if*, *while*), but not
    the OO-ness of Java.

-   The assignment code felt bulky and wrong, and I need to split it
    into separate classes/methods, but just cant figure it out.

-   My text still hasn't arrived and I'm using the 2002 version. It's
    out of date and the exercises are absolutely brimming over with
    wrongability

-   There is something weird about fully understanding every example you
    attempt to write, and knowing exactly what the lecturer is talking
    about, and reading all the chapters you are supposed to, and still
    finding that the assignment you have to submit in a week is beyond
    what you know you know. It feels like the assignment was stuck into
    the flow of the course prematurely.

That is all. If you are a Javahackercoder and you are reading this, and
you can spare a bit of your time to help explain a few things to me
about making decisions about which parts of my code to create
objects/methods from, I'd be eternally grateful ((Conditions apply,
gratitude not guaranteed to extend for eternity)).
