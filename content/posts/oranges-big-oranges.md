During my last holidays, Mil and I went to Canberra to see some family we haven't seen in ages. It was very relaxing.

Before we left, Anna and Andrew gave us strict instructions to take a photo in front of something big (Australia is renowned for our big things). So on the way back we stopped in Berri at the Big Orange. We took a couple of photos, but this was the coolest.

[This is where it is](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?t=h&ie=UTF8&hl=en&om=1&msa=0&msid=105838776264424152080.0004414959f0f59359c35&ll=-34.246349,140.620869&spn=0.001552,0.002146&z=18&source=embed)

So there you have it. Proof that we can't not do exactly what our friends tell us to.
