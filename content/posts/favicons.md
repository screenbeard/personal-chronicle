Favicons are those little icons that websites display in the address bar
(or in the open tab in Chrome). They're usually about 16 pixels square
(which is tiny) but it adds a bit of professionalism to your site, and
lets people figure out which site is yours if they have dozens of tabs
open. You can get plugins for photoshop that will let you save files as
".ico" files so you can create a favicon.ico file. Then you can upload
your file to your website and link to it and... well it's easy, but kind
of annoying to get right.

Install and activate and follow the instructions on the configuration
page. The page includes better information than I've provided here, and
a whole bunch of ideas for creating your own favicon.
