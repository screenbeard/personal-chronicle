People here are always joking that my boss and I need to clone
ourselves. Usually because computers seem to only behave when we're
peeking over someone's shoulders. With the "Digital Education
Revolution" (more computers per school), having a clone seems like it
might be the only way to keep on top of it all.

Seems someone at Microsoft has a sense of humour about it, and sent us
this clever "cloning kit" to promote their range of management tools and
software licensing options. I though it very clever.
