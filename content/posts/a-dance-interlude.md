If they don't dance...

I got sick of futzing with tumblr's idea of what size a gif should be. I
was thinking "Oh, aren't all these animated gifs cute, ((yes I know:
1999 called and wants its internet back)) that'd be easy to do..." But
then I actually tried to post one, and realised that it really only
wants you to post about 3 frames about the size of a postage stamp and
where's the fun in that?

So here's my sister dancing with my bub - because I was practicing, and
I love my sister and my bub and decided it needed posting somewhere.
