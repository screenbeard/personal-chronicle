}**He hated to admit it, but dying a second time had been informative.**

When the other had pushed him off the cliff, he'd only been moments away
from mastering what the other now called "withdrawing".

Rex conjured up the sense of awareness he'd felt in those moments, and
this time used it to make his hands dissolve away in front of his eyes.
It turned out to be just as tricky making them disappear as it was to
make them solid in that other place.

He figured he didn't need to actually think about how he would get to
the white place, as he certainly hadn't made any conscious effort last
time. That time simply dying had been enough, so he tried to concentrate
on just not being.

It was harder than he expected.

His conscious mind didn't like being not-concious, and rebelled against
being shut down. Thoughts of Jones clawed at his mind and he fought to
squash them. The Professor, not properly mourned, achingly missed, he
squashed those thoughts too. He wondered if the ship he'd sold to that
trader on Kleeb still flew as fast, and how many days it had been before
that persistent rattle that he could never locate came back to torment
its new owner. That guy must hate him for that. Not that it mattered.

Why was this so hard?

He suddenly had [a craving for
cupcakes](http://www.cupcaketreats.com.au/). What he wouldn't do for one
right now...

Rex's mind finally shut up. His consciousness folded in on itself.

And he found himself in the endless white plane.

*I did it!* he thought proudly.
