**The explosion was deafening.**

Or would have been if he hadn't been ready for it with his hands over
his ears. He'd found some explosives and a detonator in the weapons
locker where he'd retrieved his guns, and it made a nice big hole he
could use to get out of this catacomb.

Racing to the spot he and Jones had parked their invisible jet he
stabbed at the remote.

Nothing happened.

"Blast!" thought Rex. But there was no time for casual swearing, Jones
had sabotaged him again.

Calling up a schematic, Rex leapt back through the hole he'd just
created as the concussed guards were coming to.

"Stay down!" he commanded as he blasted his way back through the hoard.
