My mate Andrew thought my [last
post](//the.geekorium.com.au/css-positioning-tricks-for-beginners) was a
bit technical for him, and fair enough - it was something of limited
value to some of my readers. So this post is for him.

Andrew asked how he could create a ringtone for his new iPhone. He knew
it was possible, but it's really not straight forward (in Australia at
least, elsewhere [iTunes(ITunes)](http://www.apple.com/itunes/) has this
functionality built in). So I've whipped up this little tutorial for him
to remind him how to do it.

Some rules:

-   You need to have the right to use the music you're using. The music
    should be [DRM (Digital
    rights management)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management) free.
    Technically I don't have the right to use the song in my example.

-   The ringtone has to be 30 seconds long, and no longer. It's worth
    spending time finding exactly the section you want

-   You can use music you have created yourself. You can create and
    export it as [AAC (Advanced
    Audio Coding)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding),
    or you could just drag it into iTunes and follow my instructions

I hope this tutorial is helpful. I know there are a ton of pages that go
through this process, but Andrew reads **this** site. I'm also not sure
if it will work on Windows, maybe someone can try it and tell me.

Thank you for watching.
