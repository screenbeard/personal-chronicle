}A new theme for a new year - only one week early.

I loved my last theme (actually, my last two themes - but the C64 one
was a throwaway), but every time I make a new theme I learn something,
and I wanted to incorporate some of my new skills into a new theme.

Inspired by my most loyal reader (hello dad!) I've created "Claim", a
theme to help me stake my claim to my peice of the web, that's easier
and clearer to read. It's inspired by many, but fettered by nunn.

The *Claim* theme includes built-in support for these plug-ins:

-   [Creative Commons
    Configurator](http://www.g-loaded.eu/2006/01/14/creative-commons-configurator-wordpress-plugin/) -
    creates a licence that can be included at the base of your
    individual posts.
-   [Link Summarizer](http://mac.partofus.org/macpress/?p=40) - provides
    a list of the included links at the base of each post. Configured
    for printed pages only.
-   [Ping/Track/Comment
    Count](http://txfx.net/code/wordpress/ping-track-comment-count/) -
    Counts the comments seperately from the pings. **Recommended for
    correct function of this theme**
-   [ShareThis](http://sharethis.com/) - places a button for sharing the
    post in various social networks or via email at the base of
    each post.
-   [Wavatars](http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=1462) - an
    awesome plugin that creates a unique avatar for each commenter, or
    uses their gravatar if they have one.

Please bear with me as I tweak things around here, and if there's
anything you think I can fix, please let me know. As usual, I haven't
tested it on IE7 or earlier, so you might notice some wackyness using
those browsers. I'll sort that when I can.

#### Credits

[Jon Tan(Jon Tan(gerine), designer and
typographer)](http://jontangerine.com/) has an excellent site on design
etc that you should visit (actually, his site is awesome and you
shouldn't visit 'cause it'll make me look bad). His site has a left
margin for asides and captions which inspired mine. Hopefully he won't
mind me pinching his idea.

Tomorrows Laundry provided the blank theme that I styled and chopped up
using [TextMate(Top-notch text editing for the
mac)](http://macromates.com/) and [CSSEdit 2(Excellent CSS editing for
the mac)](http://macrabbit.com/cssedit/).

~~The [Yahoo YUI library(link to Yahoo
YUI)](http://developer.yahoo.net/yui/) created the base CSS that this
site is built on.~~

**Update: 2008-01-05 Version 2.0** The "Claim" theme was not validating
properly due to the Yahoo Reset, so in version 2.0 I've switched to
[Blueprint(Blueprint, a CSS
framework)](http://code.google.com/p/blueprintcss/).

> Blueprint is a CSS framework, which aims to cut down on your CSS
> development time. It gives you a solid CSS foundation to build your
> project on top of, with an easy-to-use grid, sensible typography, and
> even a stylesheet for printing.

-- [Blueprint CSS (Blueprint, a CSS
framework)](http://code.google.com/p/blueprintcss/) at Google Code

Today's update also includes the Blueprint print stylesheet and some
extra jiggerypokery thanks to [Footnote Links(Build fancy footnotes for
printed
pages)](http://code.google.com/p/easy-designs/wiki/FootnoteLinks)
created by [Aaron Gustafson(Original A List Apart article by Aaron
Gustafson on Footnote
Links)](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/improvingprint/).

**Update: 2008-01-09 Version 2.1** finally fixes the issues with the
left margin caption/cite/metadata positioning. Now if the post markup is
correct the page will render perfectly on every browser I've tested.

**Update: 2008-04-13 Version 2.6** Introduces:

-   A tag page with tag cloud
-   Category page title and tag title integrated into page heading
-   Removed a hard coded reference to this site
-   Changed class "updatedate" to "date"
-   Improved the category/archive pages
-   Fixed a couple of img placement problems
-   Better compatibility for linux (fixed fonts)
-   Styled the RSS feed widget to match theme
-   Nicer sidebar styles
-   Tag links added to pages

**Update: 2008-04-21 Version 2.7** Introduces:

-   A hard-coded about section, independant on widgets. The About
    section displays the Biographical Info found on your profile page on
    most pages, but on category pages, it displays info about
    the category. I may expand this later to include post excerpts.
-   Built-in support for the [Link Summarizer(Plugin page for the Link
    Summarizer plugin)](http://mac.partofus.org/macpress/?p=40) plugin.
    This produces a list of all the links in the post, and replaces
    "Footnote Links" that left numbers everywhere when styles were
    turned off. The list will only display on printed pages.
