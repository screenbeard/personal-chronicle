}Ashamed to say that I only recently learned about [Victor
Borge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Borge) who from only a few
YouTube clips I can tell was a genius - a brilliant musician and
comedian. I found him watching old Muppet Show clips, and it's clear to
me now that his style of comedy inspired a lot of the most well loved
Muppet Show routines.

What a guy

I'm sad that I'd never heard of him until I turned 30 (although I
suspect my Dad may have told me some of his jokes). A man who was an
entertainer for about 70 years and still doing shows until he died at
91.

It just goes to show that fame is fleeting. No matter how well known or
popular you may be, your fame will be lost in the noise of the next
generation. To think that one day our generation will forget that girl
who yelled "Leave Britney alone![]()" ((Wait, that was a guy?!)). We'll
forget even MJ, Gaga and Hannah Montanna.

I think the only way to truly be remembered is to be so famous that
great works of art or literature are created about you. Take Julius
Ceasar. His name is still well known thanks alone to the work of that
fine English writer, Rene Goscinny ((Asterix, you neanderthal. Look it
up.)). Of course the only problem with this plan is you have to know
which painters/writers/playwright are going to be good enough that their
works are going to be held as an example of magnificent art for the next
century or so.
