It seems that I'm the only one shocked that Google keeps putting up
pages telling users (customers) that they have a virus. For those who
don't know, some users (when making searches) are sent to a page that
declares:

> We're sorry... but we can't process your request right now. A computer
> virus or spyware application is sending us automated requests, and it
> appears that your computer or network has been infected.

Sometimes users are given the option of entering a codeword and
continuing, and other times not. It's really not a big deal for the most
part, but *it's Google's problem*. Their website says its you, but it is
not. It's left over from a time when a virus/worm was making automated
searches of Google, and now when anyone searches for "php" or "forum"
from anywhere but the main Google page or from the search bar of their
browser, they're directed to this 'virus' page.

That would be fine, people make mistakes, so Google can make mistakes
too, but this huge company (with its millions of searchers) gives you no
chance of feedback! How crazy. An Internet company (that has it's own
email service) gives no opportunity to tell them what you think about
certain practices. If someone can point me to a page that has said email
address, I'll retract what I've said, but until then...

All I'd like to see is a page that says:

> It's possible that you've had a virus, but more likely that you simply
> typed in some words that we don't like. Don't freak out. If you typed
> in 'php' or 'forum', use the codeword below to continue, and if you
> didn't and you DO have a virus... screw you
