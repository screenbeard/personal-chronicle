"Why am I doing this again?" he asked the other, his arms encircling the
rock he'd picked at random.

"\[voiceinthedark\]You must understand the universe before you can shape
it,\[/voiceinthedark\]" replied his baffling companion.

"And I'll understand the universe by hugging this rock?"

"\[voiceinthedark\]No\[/voiceinthedark\]," dismissed the other,
"\[voiceinthedark\]you will begin to understand the rock. Do not think.
Do not act. Only feel the object.\[/voiceinthedark\]"

composition, and could sense its density. He felt the moss growing at
its base, the cool sand sucking from below.

Rex started to solidify.
