Most of the Justice League have one weakness that stops them dead in
their tracks. I thought Batman was immune. Turns out he does have one
weakness though - and it took an evil duplicate to find it... Batman
can't handle a nipple cripple.

Cover of *Justice League of America \#13 - Riddle of the Robot Justice
League!*

Batman's nipples are so sensitive it takes just one tweak and he
collapses in a ball. Superman has his Kryptonite, Green Lantern the
colour yellow. Batman has glass nipples. Perhaps that's why [*Batman and
Robin*](http://imdb.com/title/tt0118688/ "IMDB entry for Batmand and Robin")
accentuated them so much - it was extra protection.

I've altered the image a little. These old Justice League comics have
such cluttered drawing. And the writing was awful compared to what I'm
used to today. Still - they do have some fun moments.
