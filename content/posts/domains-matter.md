}Hi there everyone! If you haven't already noticed, The Geekorium has
moved domains. It used to be the.geekorium.com, but we've moved to
the.geekorium.com.au - it's a small change but important, and I'll be
posting more about why I think so in future.

So if you see anything funky, let me know so I can fix it.

In other news, I have more Rex coming, I'm just a bit too busy to get it
written.
