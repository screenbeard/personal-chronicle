This is the third in a series of posts where I just plonk stuff I've been thinking about that doesn't go anywhere else. It's got a stupid title because my first thought is...

1. I have a real bad time trying to come up with good titles. I don't try too hard, so I guess it's to be expected, but I note that my titles have a similar quality to other posts I've read that strike me as amateur. If I could tell you what that _meant_ it would put me closer to rectifying it.

1. I have subscribed to a number of new "blogs" recently - as an aside, I think the word blog is awful so I will from now on refer to them as as net-logs, or personal chronicles, or whatever fits. 

    After a week of posts on Hackernews about the [death](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23205588) and [resurrection](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23237559)[^g-garron] of said personal chronicles, I thought I'd fire up the ol' RSS reader and brush off the dust.

    The first thing that struck me was how unpleasant the PHP-based software I had been using was. So instead of dicking around with it, I put my new Docker/Nginx skills to work and fired up a version of [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app/) which is just so elegant and simple to work with. I've been slowly accumulating a bunch of low-key personal chronicles by people who write about FOSS and speculate about the same kind of issues that interest me. I'll put up a list of them somewhere soon.

1. I'm looking for some diversity in my growing list - a lot of these people are other men about my age, which is a fine thing to be - I myself am a man about my age - but other view-points and ideas are also nice. I'm interested in FOSS, internet decentralisation/federation, programming, technology so I'm looking for personal chronicles with a similar bent. I'm not looking to subscribe to stuff that's completely outside my interests (eg. sport, cars, gardening etc.) but someone who occasionally shares their passions for those things amongst the stuff I'm interested in is welcome[^rubenerd]. Share your linkrolls!

1. Today I did a big Mastodon harvest - finding and following a lot of new people. This was just to widen the number of voices I'm seeing there. I have to walk the line I failed to walk on Twitter though - while it's important to be politically engaged, Twitter *doesn't* do political nuance well, and Masto probably doesn't either. I don't want a lot of politics in my feed anymore. I also need to remember that hiding people's boosts is a thing I can do.

1. I was going to say something about the protests and riots and police/military action going on in the US, but almost everything I wrote seemed flippant. I hope that whatever happens it leads to real lasting change (or the start of it).

That's another round up of stuff that's been on my mind that doesn't deserve it's own post. I guess it's also the third in the [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/)[^kevquirk] series I haven't officially committed to.

[^g-garron]: https://www.garron.blog/ is one of my first new subscriptions

[^rubenerd]: https://rubenerd.com/ gets a lot of mentions on here because he shares a lot of my passions, *but* will often share stuff I had no idea was interesting and I appreciate it.

[^kevquirk]: https://kevq.uk/ was posting almost daily and made me nostalgic for the days where I was reading lots of personal logs and occasionally keeping my own.
