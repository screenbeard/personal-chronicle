Tehe

This tickled my fancy. Over on [First
Waves](//the.geekorium.com.au/read/google-wave/) I've got a post ready
to go about Google Wave competitors, and one of the ones I mentioned was
Sharepoint. Amusingly, the spelling suggestion for it was chokepoint...

Which apparently is a geography term, but sounds kind of ridiculous.

Well I though it was amusing anyway.
