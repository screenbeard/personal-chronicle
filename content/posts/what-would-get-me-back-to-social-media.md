}I used Twitter for a while there and got quite into it. Then I got
annoyed with it and stopped using it a bit, then came back, then left,
then... you get the idea. Eventually I [officially
left](http://twitter.com/joshnunn/status/10655459092). I've also been
trying out pretty much every other social site out there and other than
Facebook (which I use primarily because most of my family do), I haven't
found one I like.

Here are the things that would get me back into it ((Please don't think
I think anyone cares if I come back or not, I'm only posting this
because people have asked.)). Pretty much only one of these things need
to happen for it to get me moving back.

-   [Twitter](http://twitter.com/) becomes more open.\
    Twitter has become this huge behemoth of information and
    vital updates. People rely on it now, which is a mistake as it's
    prone to dying horribly. I want to know that the whole thing isn't
    reliant on one company for keeping it up. Imagine if email was
    totally run by one company? You'd be completely at their mercy if
    they died or they changed the product. Email is decentralised and
    open, and it's more robust. Twitter might not seem as important a
    platform as email, but it has the potential to be a major part of
    communication on the web.

-   [Buzz](http://buzz.google.com/) gives me more control.\
    Google Buzz was the latest and greatest for about three days there,
    until everyone realised that it pretty much spews everything at you
    indiscriminately, and you have almost no control over it. If Buzz
    adds better filtering controls so I can filter out everyone's
    twitter feeds, or just Louis Grey's Google Reader shares, I'd be all
    over that. I think my friends might be too.

<!-- -->

-   [Status.Net](http://status.net/) gets more developers.\
    One of the things that pushed Twitter's growth were the extra
    services that developers made to fill in the holes. iPhone apps,
    image services, link shorteners - none of them work with Status.Net,
    the open source, open protocol competitor. I want to own my own
    updates thank you very much, but I don't want to miss out on the
    cool stuff that everyone else gets to play with either. But
    Status.Net doesn't have a lot of those cool things, like a decent
    iPhone client. Although they are [trying to fix
    it](http://status.net/2010/04/11/statusnet-for-twitter-developers).

<!-- -->

-   Any of the others get users.\
    There are a whole bunch of other services that are as good, if not
    better than the above three services, but no one uses them - well no
    one I know anyway. If any one of these services got some more of my
    favourite people on them, I'd be there in a shot.

Currently all of these services annoy me too much for me to use them.
Blogging is the only outlet I have that gives me satisfaction and full
control over my experience. It [also](http://blog.tarynhicks.com.au/)
