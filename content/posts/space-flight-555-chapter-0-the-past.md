}**I'm tracking a spacetime anomaly.**

**I'm tracking a spacetime anomaly.**

"I've never seen anything like it!"

"I've seen something like this before..."

The Professor was excited, lit up like he usually was when exploring
something unknown.

The Professor was agitated, like he usually got when he knew something
was about to end badly.

Rex laughed at his old friend's enthusiasm, "sounds like both of us have
plans for the evening!"

Rex scowled at the view on his old friend's screen, "Sounds like I need
to cancel my plans for the evening."

He turned and winked at the Princess, who rolled her eyes and turned her
head. Rex could still make out the hint of a smile crinkle the corners
of her eyes though and he smiled back, even though she wasn't looking.

He turned to say something to the Princess and remembered again that she
was gone. He still had no idea what had become of her, and The Professor
hadn't seen her either since that fateful night six months ago.

Rex switched off the holo-emersion field and gathered his Coral Specials
and his credit chip. Heading out of the hotel, he hailed a hovercab. He
handed the driver an address on a card and swiped his credit chip.

Rex gathered his Coral Specials and the special device The Professor had
pushed into his palm. He listened while the Professor explained how it
worked and what he would need to do.

"I need to go here," he said.

"Where do I need to go?" he asked.
