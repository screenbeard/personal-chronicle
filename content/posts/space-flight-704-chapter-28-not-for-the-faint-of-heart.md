}**It hadn't been particularly smart, in hindsight.**

He wasn't sure what he was going to do once he found him, but as soon as
he'd realised Jones was the source of the ripples he felt, he began
searching him out.

Reaching out with his mind, silencing his thoughts, he'd focussed on the
energy. Groping around like a blind man in an unfamiliar room, he
touched something.

He did not like what he found.

Violence, anger and misery hit him like a storm. Amongst the mielstrom
he could make out something else familiar, a power and strength of will
he recognised.

He recoiled at once, but the damage was done. Jones had felt the touch.
Before he could withdraw, his being exploded with pain and light, then
darkness as a thousand savage terrors were loosed on him. With effort he
clawed his way out back into his Rex shell, back to the safety and
comfort of solid body and flesh brain.

"That was a mistake," he said as he tried to catch his breath.
