Man I love on-site warranties. Nothing beats not having to lift a finger
to fix a problem that you just know would normally be a nightmare to
fix.

No more frantically replacing random parts hoping and praying that it's
a part that you actually have spare. No more calls to various parts
vendors for the obscure broken component, only to have to travel across
town to the only place that MIGHT have it in stock. No more hunting for
boxes big enough to hold the dead PC so you can ship it back to be
repaired at base, only to have it returned in three weeks - just long
enough to have been berated daily by the user who **needs** it, but not
long enough to declare it legally dead and have it replaced.

Nope. On-site warranties all the way. Sure it might cost you a little
more, but it's worth it - just knowing that if something dies, it'll be
fixed by week's end with no more than a phone call.
