Beau is one of my few core Twitterers who I haven't actually ever met in person. But he's the epitome of what the internet means for relationships for me. Though we've never met I've known him for about a year now, and I respect his knowledge of technology, I appreciate his perspective as a high school student, and I love his enthusiasm and sense of humour on Twitter.

He was one of the first people to follow me on Twitter (out of the blue), and then a few days later emailed me for access to a locked website I administer. I'm pretty certain it was completely coincidental[^1] but if he hadn't added me to Twitter I would have given him access, as it was only through Twitter I knew he was a high school student and not a teacher as I would have assumed - HA!

I've followed his websites in their various incarnations over the last year. Unfortunately I've only realised in writing this that his entire site has moved AGAIN, and I need to re-subscribe to [his blog](http://sellingexpectations.com/). It's packed with tips and tech news and obviously updated a lot more often than I've been thinking for the last month or so!

If you want to follow someone who's full of energy and enthusiasm, is a little quirky, has a passion for geekery, and I suspect may have a little of the drama queen in him[^2] you can find him on Twitter [@beaugiles](http://twitter.com/beaugiles).

[^2]: in a totally endearing way!
