**He was fearsome.**

Rex Havoc called to the stars. He summoned the energy of heavenly
bodies.

The power of life, of darkness, of cold and heat filled him,
strengthened him and threatened to overwhelm him.

He was floating, flying, becoming *everything*.

The Jones-thing screamed and held tighter. Anger and fear channeled
Rex's strength and he lashed out, forcing the creature to retreat.

The Uber-Rex advanced, sure in himself and powered by the universe's
endless abundant will to be. Jones faltered, hesitated and shrunk back
further and Rex pushed his mind deep into Jones' being and unleashed all
the fury of a universe threatened.

The Jones-thing laughed. And then it renewed its onslaught, stronger
than before. Flashing claws ripped at Rex and tore away the threads that
bound him to the universe like they were mere cobwebs.

Rex's mind almost gave way. He'd thrown the combined power of the
universe at Jones and his nemisis had shrugged it off.

Rex fled.
