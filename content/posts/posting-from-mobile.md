One thing that moving away from WordPress means is that I can no longer publish on the go.

I mean, I never really did, but at least I had the option. Now to post I must be in front of my PC with the Hugo software installed and a copy of my repo. I could get the repo on any computer and even install Hugo if I needed to be elsewhere, but my home computer has the key to log into my server, so I'm not making it easy on myself.

I can however, use a portable git client (I'm trying out [FastHub for GitHub](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fastaccess.github) and write my posts on the go, then tidy and publish them later. 

I'm banking on the idea that reducing the barriers to **writing** will increase the number of posts that get published. We'll see.
