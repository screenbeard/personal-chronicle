Just when I start to think that maybe we'll cope, and things couldn't
get any worse then they were before, turns out I'm wrong.

I wake up at four o'clock, and Mil says she can't move. She needs to
have a drink and take a pill, but she can't make herself move. Maybe I
was just over tired, but I was scared - she said she felt paralyzed. And
I got up and helped her out. But all the time, I couldn't help but
think:

OK, He won't help me with my piddly little problems, fine - I'm not that
important anyway. But is he helping with bigger problems? No. Not that I
can see. Just this last weekend - tens of thousands of people could be
dead from MULTIPLE tragedies, wars, earthquakes, hurricanes - in one
weekend!', 'So maybe he doesn't do anything about these things for his
own reasons - I guess I can live with that too... THEN WHY SHOULD I GIVE
HIM THE CREDIT FOR GOOD THINGS THAT HAPPEN? Why should I thank him for
sunshine and flowers? Why thank him for Mil? If he doesn't meddle with
our problems, why would he care to meddle with our lives at all?

I want to believe what I used to believe. That at the end of the day,
it's OK, cause God's in control. But I can't feel it.

Enough on that...

Mil seems OK now though. She's sleeping. It's not unusual to sleep as
late as ten, but it's usually a lighter sleep. Drugs will do that. I'm
taking the day off as I didn't get back to sleep, plus I had so much
going on in my head that I had to start this blogging thing. Nothing
like perfect strangers reading about your insignificant life to make you
feel normal (hehe).
