By now if you've been using Wave long enough you should know that a
search for \[with:public\] gets you a big long fast updating list of all
the Waves that people have shared with the world. If you've been reading
the [Complete Guide to Google
Wave](http://completewaveguide.com/guide/The_Complete_Guide_to_Google_Wave)
you might know to narrow down the search with tags and terms too.

But were you aware that Local Waves have popped up everywhere as well,
and you can find users near you just by plugging your city/suburb into
the search (with the public wave search) eg. \[with:public *city
name*\]. If you can't immediately find a Wave for your location, you can
start one! Just create a crafty title, and [make the Wave
public](http://completewaveguide.com/guide/Dive_Deeper_into_Wave#Make_a_Wave_Public).
Encourage people who join to mark themselves on a map, and shout out
their Twitter/social details for people to connect elsewhere.

Have a tonne of fun, and stay safe!
