Wolfenstein, busting out of your iPhone

</div>

When I was 13 I was around at my mate's place as often as I could be
just to play [Wolfenstein
3D](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D "Wolfenstein 3D"){.zem_slink}
on his better-than-mine system. He had colour graphics and a sound card,
while my Commodore 64 only had enough grunt for side-scrolling
platformers and breakout clones ((Not to besmirch the C64 - in any other
context the machine was the best thing invented.)) and my IBM clone
could barely muster monochrome. Wolfenstein was the pinnacle of gaming.
It was just like you were there, with your little gun waving in front of
you and meals left on the floor. And B.J. Blazkowicz's face peering out
at you to remind you to keep away from big men with chain-guns. I
couldn't play it enough.

Seriously. Couldn't play it nearly as much as I wanted. My mate wanted
to play too, and I couldn't really stay there all the time playing his
computer. **Multiplayer** was not invented for 3D shooters until
Goldeneye ((yes I know)), so I had precious little time to play it. Add
four strict Christian parents hovering around and I never got to play
more than a few levels.

I still remember clicking space at every wall panel to try and find the
secrets on the precious few levels I played. Remember the glee at
finding a new gun levels before you we due to find it just lying around
in the course of the game later on.

Every [first-person
shooter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter "First-person shooter"){.zem_slink}
to come since has built on wolf3d.exe - adding a bobbing gun, smarter
bad guys, and polygons, but they're all trying to capture the same sense
of joy 13 year-olds got playing this game for the first time. Knowing
instinctively that this was the beginning of something monumentally
**fun**. For me, every first-person shooter since has been just as
frustratingly out-of-reach for me too. I've never had the hardware
required to play the groundbreaking games that have been released.

But not today. Today I have Wolfenstein 3D on my iPhone. [Lovingly
re-crafted](http://www.idsoftware.com/wolfenstein3dclassic/wolfdevelopment.htm)
by the man who made it the first time round. Full of the same bad-guys,
the same weapons and the same secrets. I have in my pocket something I
couldn't run on the machine on my dad's desk. It's my proudest purchase,
and one of my fastest ((Although funny story - the iTunes store kept
dying for me JUST FOR THIS ONE PURCHASE)).
