This is so great I wanted to laugh **and** cry. I miss the Muppets **so much**. Whoever is responsible for their Youtube channel needs to be paid ten times what they are getting, for bringing back the spirit of the Muppets from before Jim died. The last few movies and straight-to-video offerings were quaint and fun, but nothing like what they used to be. Youtube is their new home, and is suits them well.

Bravo! Encore! More! More!
