In the space of two days we've jumped from five to eight chickens, and while we have some time to plan for it, this means one of two things:

1. We prepare to sell two or three chickens when they're older
2. We prepare to keep two or three chickens when they're older and I build another coop that can house 8 or more chickens at once.

As I have three children, option 1 was discussed, but never once taken seriously by anyone involved in the discussions, and now I need to learn how to build things with wood.

Hard hard can it be?

Here are some chickens:
