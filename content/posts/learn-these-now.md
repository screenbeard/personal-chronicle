The Wave experience can quickly become frustrating as your conversations
get longer. It can take a couple of mouse-clicks to reply in the middle
of a blip and then again to finish the blip. If you’re constantly
shifting from keyboard to mouse and back again, your productivity can
quickly suffer.

But take the time to learn some of these handy shortcuts and you’ll find
the user interface less baffling and the usefulness of Wave will
increase (I guarantee it!). For example, you can use "Shift + Enter" to:

> Reply to a message at the end of a wave. The new message will appear
> at the same indentation level, at the very end of the wave.
>
> \[... But also has the ...\]
>
> Same function as ‘Done’ button - signifies you are finished editing
> your addition to a wave.\
> Just this one shortcut has made my experience of Wave a thousand times
> better. You might find something that helps you out too!
