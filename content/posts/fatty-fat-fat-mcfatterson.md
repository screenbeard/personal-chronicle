Today is the day.

Months ago I started wishing I had a bigger monitor for my Mac. I use
dual monitors at work and I cannot deny how much easier it makes my
life. I thought ideally I'd love a 24 inch monitor (such as a DELL -
Apple's monitors are **expensive**) so I started checking out prices. Of
course, I cannot justify such an expense.

I begged Mil anyway, but she wouldn't have a bar of it.

Well we just made a deal. I've needed some incentive to lose some
weight, so Mil agreed that I could buy my fancy 24" monitor if I lost
some weight (I spend way to much time on my arse).

So today is **not** the day I buy my monitor. Oh no. Today is the day I
begin. Losing weight. Changing my lifestyle, cutting down on bad foods,
and exercising regularly (rather than never).

To prepare for the challenge, I started researching my ideal weight and
checking online resources for an idea of what to aim for. I've never
been happy with my weight, so I've tried to find a size and weight that
I might be satisfied with. In doing the research I discovered something
pretty scary that I probably could have guessed but hadn't wanted to
know. I'm obese. Maybe people who know me could have said that, but I
always thought I was just overweight, not obese. So that was a shock.
Anyway the challenge details:

My height: 177.5cm (5'10")

My Current weight: 106.8kg (235.45lbs)\
making my BMI: 33.9 - Obese\
According to most sites I found, my ideal BMI is 25. That would make my
weight 70kg. I don't know how doable that is, but I'm aiming a smidgen
higher.

So, the goal is 80kg (I need to lose 26.8 kg) by 31st July 2008 - one
year from my 27th birthday. That's only 2.23kg loss per month (5lb)
which I understand is very doable. It'll make my BMI 25.4, which is just
fine by me. Mil's gonna back me all the way.

I'm including some nasty photos of me as of today to incentivise me to
keep trying, 'cause it sure as hell won't be my love of exercise. If you
are reading this, whether you know me or not, please leave a note of
encouragement for me.

Wish me luck!
