**He was infuriating and insufferable.**

She hated to admit, he had his charms and a certain dangerous allure,
but most of the time he also held an air of entitlement that made her
feel like an accessory. And the way he called her nothing but "Princess"
all the time, like he hadn't bothered to learn her name? Ugh.

She had not been remotely interested in him, but overnight he seemed to
have developed some... manners.

He'd left for his Sheebat game three days earlier and neither she nor
The Professor had heard from him until he turned up back at base (a lot
further than three days travel from where he'd been) like nothing had
happened.

She'd been about to make a flippant remark about calling them when he
was going to stay out late, when he'd surprised her with a bear-hug.

"What's this for?" she'd asked mid-hug, trying to decide how to return
it.

"Just missed you is all," he'd replied - she was shocked to realise -
sincerely.

"Anrianna."

She was dumbfounded. She suggested to The Professor in private that he
run some scans on this man who was clearly an impostor. He laughed and
informed her the base already did that to everyone on entry, and this
was definately Rex Havoc.

She wasn't convinced though, so that night over dinner she told him
about growing up on Khenna, and instead of loudly changing the subject,
he listened.

She knew then something was up, and she was damn sure going to get to
the bottom of it.
