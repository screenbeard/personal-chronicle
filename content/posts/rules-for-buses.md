3.  Your bus will sometimes just not show up. The next bus will be late
    (see rule 1).\

4.  How late the bus will be is directly proportional to how desperate
    you are to be on time.\

5.  The size of the bus is inversely proportional to the number of
    people who catch the bus. As the seating capacity reaches zero,
    passenger numbers approach infinity.\
