Emaily is a bot that sends an email alert for every new blip in a
specified wave.

If your main inbox is your email inbox then this bot could be an
important part of your wave testing, at least until Wave catches on with
more of your personal network. Instead of keeping Wave open all day,
have this bot send you a ping when anyone updates the important waves.

One day though I hope to see the flow reversed, and email will flow in
and out of Wave instead.
