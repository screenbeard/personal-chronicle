}> The Google Wave APIs come in two flavors: Embed and Extensions. With
> Embed, you’re able to bring waves into your own site through a simple
> JavaScript API. For example, embedding a wave in a webpage is a good
> way to encourage a discussion among the visitors. With Extensions,
> you’re able to write programs, which are packaged as Robots or
> Gadgets, that provide rich functionality inside the Google Wave web
> client.
