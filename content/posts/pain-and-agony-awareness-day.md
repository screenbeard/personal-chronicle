Sorry 'bout the title. It's Chronic Fatigue and Fibromyalgia Awareness Day [again](//the.geekorium.com.au/bluehair). I haven't done anything this year to raise awareness, except I've tried to sum up [Chronic Fatigue](http://twitter.com/joshnunn/statuses/809079681) and [Fibromyalgia](http://twitter.com/joshnunn/statuses/809083353) in 140 characters on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com "Twitter").
