title: Wave To Posterous
url: /wave-to-posterous/
---
Google fan Lookon has created a [Bot to post to his Posterous
blog](http://posterous-robot.appspot.com/ "Posterous Bot"), and written
detailed instructions on how to do it.

It's straight forward enough, add the bot and log in to the form it
gives you. The next time you add the bot to a wave, the first wavelet
gets posted at Posterous and it returns the URL for you to check.

Posterous seems to have the most diverse posting options of any blogging
software available, and the addition of posting from waves puts it again
at the forefront.

Now the bot needs to monitor comments and return them to the original
wave for even tighter integration.
