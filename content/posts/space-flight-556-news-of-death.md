**"You're from the future![]()"**

The Professor was amused and amazed.

"So where is our Rex?" he asked.

"Well, you can't tell the Princess or Jones, but he's dead. Blasted away
by Mondex."

The news struck The Professor like a bullet to the chest. He stumbled
and grasped for the stool behind him. Sitting down he tried a few times
to speak, and finally said, "but that's impossible! You would cease to
be! The paradox here could destabilize the universe."

Rex rested a hand on his old friend's shoulder.

"That's why I'm here. I've already started forgetting what happened the
first time 'round, and I'm afraid if I return to the future, my death
might catch up to me. If I stay here, maybe I can make myself useful,
and at least save the Princess."

"What happens to Anrianna?" The Professor could see the future
unraveling before his eyes.

"I don't know. Maybe my memory of that has been erased too, but now I
can prevent it. Before I left for my Sheebat game you spotted an
anomaly. That was Mondex, travelling back from the future to kill me in
the past. In the future we were waiting for it because I left a message
for myself about what Mondex was planning. I came through the vortex
after him, but I don't know what happened differently this time and he
succeeded."

"Rex I... don't know what to say. I'm glad you're alive for now. Maybe
it will give me time to find a way to change what happened. At least I
might figure out how to keep you alive. I'll begin studying the anomaly
at once."

Rex dropped Mondex's time-belt on The Professor's work bench.

"Maybe this will help."
