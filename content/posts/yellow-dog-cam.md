Al's class of miniLegends got me this wonderful gift on Monday to say
thank you for fixing and running the school's computers (it was SSO
week).

Little yellow dog is watching me

He's a little yellow doggy with a web camera in his nose. The
[miniLegends have posted some pictures of
him](http://alupton.edublogs.org/sso-week-and-josh/ "miniLegends post about my web cam dog")
one close up, and one showing the unfortunate location of his USB cable
(and me, looking terrible).

As their post says, bright yellow is my favourite colour and I was
really wanting a web cam - so it really was a most excellent gift.

Thank you miniLegends, thank you Al - you made my day!
