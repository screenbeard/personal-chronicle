I love technology. The thrill of new possibilities. The excitement of
learning. There's nothing that beats it.

Actually, that's a complete lie. There is something that beats it. Beats
it hands down. Without question.

I love my baby girl. The thrill of her potential. The excitement of
seeing her learn. By gum it's the greatest feeling I've ever
experienced, to watch her discover her world.

Hax0r the interw3bz

I'm totally looking forward to teaching her everything I can about the
earth. The people on it, the cultures, the life, the bizarre phenomena
we just can't explain yet. I know she'll be just as fascinated as I am.
And I'm hoping that she turns out to be a geek like her Dad.

I'm not saying that technology can beat long healthy walks, or
travelling, or hands on experience. But by golly, it can help fill some
of the gaps in my knowledge. When Little asks why the sky is blue, we're
going to google it ((that is, "Use the Google branded search engine")).
When Little wants to know where milk comes from, we're going to look it
up on Wikipedia together. And I'm going to use the technology I have at
my fingertips to show her a wider world than I could, just on my meagre
wages alone.

But the important part about it is I'm going to be with her.

When I give her the password to her shiny new
[Gmail](http://gmail.com "Gmail"){.zem_slink} account (it's already set
up!) I'm going to be there to hold her hand and teach her about spam.
When I give her her own
[Twitter](http://twitter.com "Twitter"){.zem_slink} account, I'll be
there to show her how to block those strange people who just want her to
buy things. And when I help her make her own web page (xhtml and css
standards compliant) we're going to explore the pros and cons of
publishing an email address on the site, and how we can still
communicate with people without exposing ourselves to harm.

I've been looking forward to this for over a year now. And by the time
it comes to start all this, I'll be ready. My wife will be ready. We're
going to show her the brave new world where information is at our
fingertips, and new ways of communicating are instantaneous and free.

Except that maybe it won't be. By the time my girl is old enough to
read, the Australian Government may have implemented their "cleanfeed"
policy. The [Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital
Economy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Broadband%2C_Communications_and_the_Digital_Economy_%28Australia%29 "Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (Australia)"){.zem_slink},
Senator Stephen Conroy has been pushing a plan (that starts trials this
month) that will see every internet connection in Australia filtered for
"illegal and inappropriate" material. This sounds good on the surface,
until you realise that something similar has been tried by the previous
government which was in Conroy's own words "millions of dollars of
wasted taxpayer's money". The new scheme, which will see the internet
filtered by the internet provider, has had \$126 million allocated to it
already, and one can only presume that when they see how appalling the
results are, even more money will be sunk into something that critics
have been saying from the outset will never ever work as intended.

Why am I appalled by something that's supposed to be about protecting my
child? Something that stops Amelynne seeing nudie pictures, or spares
her the horror of "goatse ((yeah, don't look that up))" must be a good
thing right?

Wrong. Here's why:

1.  I work in a school. I wrote [two months
    ago](http://nunnone.com/education/reliance/ "Reliance - a post on nunnone.com")
    that I see too many teachers (and parents) letting technology do
    their job for them. Years ago it was television, and now it's the
    internet that we plonk our kids down in front of, and expect them to
    learn or be entertained. Then we complain that the device is
    teaching them the wrong values? How screwed up is that? If you are
    concerned for your child's mind, teach them with their hand
    in yours. Don't expect an electronic baby sitter to know what values
    you want passed on. If a filter goes in, how many parents will dust
    off their hands thinking the "internet problem" has been solved?
    That is dangerous.

2.  I also see the technology fail to many times to be useful. We have
    mandatory filters in place in every school in South Australia, and I
    know how often legitimate sites are wrongly categorised, or
    overzealously filtered. I also see how much "inappropriate" material
    gets through regardless. The internet is spawning hundreds of new
    sites every day, and before a filter works, it has to have looked at
    each of those sites and classified it as safe or not. If you let the
    technology do it, you end up with false positives (or negatives)
    that can seem almost random, and if you get a human to do it, it's
    subject to their prejudices or frame of mind. I think in a school
    it's possibly a necessity to have something like this in place, but
    in every home? That's madness.

3.  The technology cannot keep up. As well as the millions upon millions
    of sites that must be blocked, you have the problem of the internet
    traffic of every user in Australia needing to go through some sort
    of filtering technology. I see massive slowdowns at work when even
    half our school use the internet at once. A lot of the slowness can
    be attributed to the filtering technology. It's just not at the
    stage where it can reliably catch "illegal and inappropriate"
    material without slowing down the connection significantly. In a
    country that is simultaneously trying to create a national broadband
    network that improves broadband speeds, it's inconceivable to put
    such a serious bottleneck in place.

4.  We've already seen politicians use the proposed filter to further
    their personal agendas. Family First wants all pornography blocked,
    and even reliable old Nick Xenophon has made noise that he might
    want online gambling blocked. In both cases it might be argued that
    they are totally right to want these blocked, but how long before a
    new government or political lobby group decides that their
    particular bugbear - gay marriage, or abortion, or pre-marital sex -
    is inappropriate "for the children", and we no longer see it on our
    internet? That's all too possible.

5.  It wont stop the damage being done by the real criminals. The
    majority of illegal activity online is done through "peer to peer"
    networks - that is, groups of people who bypass the Google and
    Youtube internet, and go straight for the content they want from
    other people that have it. It's the way that people who download
    movies and music predominantly do it. This sort of traffic isn't
    illegal in-and-of itself, and law makers cannot block it outright,
    any more than you could stop all Australia Post mail for the
    occasional illegal package that gets sent through it ((Which reminds
    me: internet filtering is not going to stop people sending each
    other illegal material through the post - should every letter be
    opened and inspected before being sent, and should you have to
    opt-out of such a system to have your "gentleman's
    magazines" delivered?)). So regular folk will be inconvenienced in
    the ways I've mentioned, and criminals will continue to do whatever
    they want. Once again, Joe Six-Pack ((Gosh I hate that term)) gets
    the raw end of the deal.

So that's why I think this is a Bad Thing^TM^. But don't take my word
for it. Some smart people have written why they think its a colossal
waste of money. Why it won't do anything but hurt you and me, and do
nothing to stop real criminals. Read their opinions, and make up your
own mind. If you explore their sites, you'll even find the other side of
the debate. But keep in mind - no one with a knowledge of the technology
has said it's a good idea.

-   Start with [No Clean
    Feed](http://nocleanfeed.com/ "link to the No Clean Feed website")

-   Browse around "[Somebody Think of the
    Children](http://www.somebodythinkofthechildren.com/ "link to the Somebody think of the children website")"

-   Check out what [average internet
    users](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23nocleanfeed "Search of Twitter for #nocleanfeed")
    are saying about it

These sites will also direct you in ways you can help oppose the
proposal. I'll be writing to my local member for a start, and if you're
concerned I recommend you do the same.

I truly hope we can stop this travesty. It's a disgrace in more ways
than one. I want my child to grow up in a world where information is at
her fingertips, in a fraction of a second. The "cleanfeed" will make
this a memory for us older folk. Don't let that happen.
