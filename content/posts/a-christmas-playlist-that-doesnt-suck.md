Embedded here are a bunch of Christmas favourites done by some of the
best modern artists I could find ((And yes I know some of them haven't
been "modern" for some time, but it's not John Denver at least.)). No
Boney M for my family this Christmas ((who am I kidding - my sister
loves them))! Let me know if there's anyone I've missed out! And no mum,
Celine Dion doesn't count.

Oh, and here's a special playlist [just for
Paul](http://listen.grooveshark.com/playlist/A+Very+8+bit+Christmas/41416810).

**Merry Christmas everyone![]()**
