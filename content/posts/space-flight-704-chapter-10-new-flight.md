**That wasn't supposed to happen.**

Rex had believed, the way everyone believes, that he would live forever.
He knew *technically* that this was not possible, and had a suspicion
he'd die in the midst of a fiery battle or chained in a dungeon, but
never-the-less the human brain likes to think it will continue forever
despite all evidence to the contrary.

The fact that Rex's consciousness was now slowly gathering itself
together in an endless white plain was both reassuring (to that part of
him that couldn't accept death) and at the same time utterly terrifying.

"Where am I?" whimpered the swirling chaos of Rex's essence.
