Just a quick update. I've wanted to write for a while because I have a
lot of questions spinning around in my head. The problems are - I have
no time to think, and the thoughts are so large and complex that I
cannot hold them together for a long enough time to write them down.

So this is just to document that I'm still thinking over all the
questions I have. I'm still hoping for a message from God. I've been
following discussion at the [Dilbert
Blog](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com "Scott Adam's Dilbert Blog") - or
at least the parts that pertain to my questions, and Scott Adams puts
into words some of the same questions that have shaken my faith. At the
same time, I have talked with people of faith and been to the funeral of
my wife's grandmother - stirring the old feelings of belonging and
satisfaction I had being a part of the church.

You might think the answer is obvious, and from day to day I flop from
feeling either that religion is silly, or that I wish to return to it.
My confusion is great, and I don't see an answer in sight.
