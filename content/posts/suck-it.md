}Apologies for this one. When I did the first two, I didn't much care how
they turned out - I decided if I couldn't get them in one take, that it
wasn't worth my time. Now with this one, I have a better camera, greater
volume and a nicer setting, and the stupid demo of Pinnacle I downloaded
can't seem to handle the titles I added without chopping the video up so
much it HURTS ME. So I've exported it multiple times with no success,
and I'm not re-doing it in a different program, so you have to suck it.
Stupid Pinnacle.

Today I discuss the remainder of the Orphans trilogy I mentioned last
week. I also mention my sister's site [Tiny Little
Glows](http://tinylittleglows.com) that you have to go visit, because
it's so much more entertaining than this one.

Thanks for watching my vids so far!
