power\[/voiceinthedark\]**

% \[voiceinthedark\]But those below hummed with it, exuded it like a
bright light from their being.\[/voiceinthedark\]%

it.\[/voiceinthedark\]%

% \[voiceinthedark\]The power was similar to that which you posses. It
understood all things it touched, and embraced all it
understood.\[/voiceinthedark\]%

the others cast them down.\[/voiceinthedark\]%
