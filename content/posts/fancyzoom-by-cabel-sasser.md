Oddly named [Cabel's Blog LOL](http://www.cabel.name/) has a fancy-pants
(a technical term apparently) javascripty image zooming tool called
FancyZoom. I've installed it for this post, but if it ain't working go
[here](http://www.cabel.name/2008/02/fancyzoom-10.html). It's very
simple to set up, and once it's done, if you link to an image (via
thumbnail or text link) the image will pop out of the page when visitors
click it.\
It's pretty.

I've turned of the fancyzoom javascript. It was huge, and was partially
to blame for my sites slow performance for the last little while.
turning it off was a quick fix.
