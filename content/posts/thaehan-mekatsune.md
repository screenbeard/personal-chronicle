I want to share the album I was listening to while I [figured out how to dockerise Hugo]({{< ref "Dockerised-Hugo-for-Local-Development" >}}). It's such an upbeat listen that I didn't notice when it looped through and played again. I was listening on soundcloud through docker-tizonia but I'll leave you the Spotify link for [Thaehan - Mekatsune](https://open.spotify.com/album/1uQREKinZrrI073apO5OMK?si=MRd_VCPkSjGssfDlzPSlkw) and the FULL LP on Youtube

My two fave tracks are Chapô Chapô and Goblins, but you make up your own mind. 

NOTE: I added the above as sign off on another post a few weeks ago, but re-listened to some of their music again today and decided they deserved a separate post. I'm totally blown away by their music. And as an additional bonus for re-reading this post if you saw it at the bottom of the last one, here's a newer trilogy track called [Mechanical Heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv_LbR6jlwk).
