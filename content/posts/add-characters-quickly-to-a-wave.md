}Wave has a WYSIWYG interface for styling your blips. For those of us
used to working on the web however, the default Bold/Italic/Dot-point
tools can leave a lot to be desired. Many wont have a character pallet
handy, or remember the windows/mac keyboard codes for producing various
glyphs either. But if you’ve worked on the web long enough, you might be
familiar with HTML/unicode character entities such as `&amp;` (&) and
`&bull;` (•).

If you need to add various characters to your waves, and **are**
familiar with HTML entities, then the Character Entity bot might be what
you need. Add `character-entity`appspot.com@ to your wave, and whenever
you write a character (in the format `&code;`) the bot will happily
convert the code into the correct characters for you.

Here are a few to try:

-   `&copy;` becomes ©
-   `&harr;` becomes ⟷
-   `&there4;` becomes ∴
