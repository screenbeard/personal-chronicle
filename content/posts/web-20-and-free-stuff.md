I must have the best and latest of everything. This holds true for me as
long as my budget holds up. In fact, its less 'latest and greatest' and
more 'what people are willing to give me' most of the time. Not that I'm
cheep, just that I'm poor.

Not that it would make much difference I suppose, who wants to pay for
stuff you can probably get for free. Take software for example. I've
found free versions of almost every app I've wanted to use. When I first
got my computer I spent hours searching online for free software to make
the tiniest of jobs simpler or quicker. Because I could.

For about a year I used Safari on my Mac. It was free, it came with
Apple's design and endorsement, and could therefore be trusted to
integrate itself into the operating system without hassle. I started
subscribing to rss feeds at about the same time that Apple released
Tiger, and with it the new improved Safari 2.0. Safari 2.0 had lots of
cool stuff I was sure I needed, but couldn't afford the upgrade to
Tiger. Then Safari started crashing. A lot. I tried to fix it but to no
avail. I had already tired of Internet Explorer at my all PC workplace
and switched to Firefox. I thought, why not do the same at home?

I haven't looked back (except maybe the once I've started Safari by
accident using Quicksilver, and I felt a wave of nostalgia for its
beautiful brushed metal). Firefox gives me a clean consistant experience
between work and home, and allows me to do amazing things like keep my
bookmarks in sync (now even easier with
[Foxmarks](http://www.foxcloud.com/wiki/Foxmarks)). But it got me
thinking... How many things can I keep in sync between work and home?

Then I 'discovered' Web 2.0... what a find! I can create documents, keep
a calendar, write to-do lists, even write screenplays, all from my
browser, allowing me to access these things from anywhere. I've
gone-a-hunting for as many useful sites as I can find. My next post I'll
be listing the best ones I've found so far, and the ways I'm using them.
