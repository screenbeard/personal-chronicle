}A few weeks ago I posted on G+ that I'd [enabled IPv6 on my home
network](https://plus.google.com/101929452061447291902/posts/Lf47ynbPHE3)
through Internode's experimental support. The couple of responses I got
were variations of "why?" which is understandable, as it's kinda like
turning on a second version of the internet where there's Google and a
tumble-weed.

But now, thanks to the power of
[CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/), The Geekorium is here now
too!

Ping me bitch!

Eventually I hope to set up IPv6 "correctly" through my host, but
they're waiting for CPanel to support it. I'm sure that will happen
soon. In the meantime, through the [magic of pixies and
fairies](http://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflares-automatic-ipv6-gatewa),
I'm doing it now!

So if you're on IPv6, come by! We're open 24/7.
