}Google Wave is dead. I don't care. For a while I did care, and I had a
site about Google Wave called First Waves. I've shut it down and
[incorporated the posts back into The
Geekorium](//the.geekorium.com.au/read/google-wave/). This post is just
in case 1 person still had me in their feed reader and wondered why they
started getting posts about a [Space
Hero](//the.geekorium.com.au/read/space-flight-704/).

So there you go.
