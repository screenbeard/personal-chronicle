Rex let his awareness expand, encompassing the planet.

He sensed a rift between two peoples. He couldn't really see much of a difference, at least not at the deepest levels he could feel them. Pulling back, trying to focus on the conflict, he could see one group were more fearful of the other.

Geographically, the group the others most feared were separated and underground. He sensed a familiar power concentrated there.

"These people call themselves the Torim," Rex said, realisation dawning, "and those underground... They are the Torim below."
