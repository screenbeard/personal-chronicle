This puppy looks like mine - and he looks so happy! I found this image
through [Things Look Like
Things](http://tlltworld.blogspot.com/2007/09/fun-in-blue.html "Things Look Like Things Website")
and immediately showed it to Mil. I don't know if littlelakey used any
tricks to get this shot, but I don't care cause I think it's gorgeous.
