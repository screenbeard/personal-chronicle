I have just started reading *Psycho* by Robert Bloch. Actually, I think
I may have read it before, but it's hard to tell. Of course I've seen
the movie, which confuses the issue further, but I can't help feeling
like I've compared it to the movie before. Please understand, it's not
that I remember **reading** it, just comparing it to the movie...

So now I'm all confused. For those of you who haven't seen the movie:
Why not? Do yourself a favour. Those of you jaded by today's clich√©d
Hollywood movies, rent this and see it tonight. Don't get the colour
remake, get the Alfred Hitchcock original. It's a masterpiece. The story
(courtesy of Robert Bloch) is stunning, and in Alfred's hands could have
only be made even better.

So no, it doesn't matter that I haven't read it. Or don't think I have.
Only that I'm going to.

<span class="date">Update: 2006-03-14</span> I've finished reading it
now, and I made Mil re-watch it with me (I ignored her protests - it's
not scary

It really is great. I didn't understand what people meant when I first
watched it - but it truly is a remarkable story, in both forms. If Peter
Jackson's [*Lord of the
Rings*](http://imdb.com/title/tt0120737/ "imdb entry for Fellowship of the Ring")
couldn't convince you that a book can be made into a movie without some
of the bits you'd think should be kept, then maybe Alfred's treatment of
Robert's story will. And Mil loved it too.\
