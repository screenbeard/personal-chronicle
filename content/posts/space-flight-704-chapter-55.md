}**It took a while.**

The Ortrix had led an interesting existence. As the time-belt it had
observed the beginning and end of governments, watched the deaths of
lovers and seen evil men frustrated over and over again. Empires rose
and fell on its unyielding law. When used as a weapon, it more often
than not backfired. When used for personal gain, it invariably led to
heartbreak.

Those who used it well learned to ride it, saw some sights and left
things mostly the way they were.

The time-belt did not allow time to change, but it did cause some
mind-bending time loops.
