Rex watched time unfold in silence, the other by his side. He didn't
look at his companion as they watched, but he sensed the tension
permeating the non-space they shared.

He watched the Torim drive their fellow Torim underground. In deep
cavernous bunkers they waited, uncertain, afraid, but too generous to
resist.

He watched the Torim above make plans. They sensed the amassed energy of
their captives below and it drove them, ever fearful, to unspeakable
acts.

Rex shuddered.
