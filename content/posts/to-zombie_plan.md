I've not actually met you in "real life" yet, and much of what I know of
you I have only learned through your blorgs, twoots and videos of you
getting slapped... which seems to be more often than regular folk.

Regardless: **Happy Birthday**.

I'm glad you're having a good year. I hope you don't grow up as soon as
you think you should. We should meet sometime soon.
