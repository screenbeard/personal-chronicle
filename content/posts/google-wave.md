}Finally got around to watching this. If Google's Wave takes off (and it
will), it will change everything. This is better than email, better than
IM, better than a personal wiki. Within months of this going live, we
will have a million new ways to communicate. That they've made it open
source makes it more likely than any other tool to change how we
communicate via the web.
