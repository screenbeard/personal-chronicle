**But the Torim below survived.**

Not as physical beings. Not when their bodies were forcibly taken.
Reduced to so much ash and dust.

Not as minds. The Torim below had found a power that linked them deeper
than that simple structure.

Not as a single being, but as an entity of thought and presence and
power.

And in the caverns of Torim, an Ortrix.
