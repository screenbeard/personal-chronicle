I've scoured Soundcloud to find the best Christmas music I could find.
It's chock full of Christmas favourites (and a few new ones) that are
guaranteed to:

1.  Bring Christmas cheer
2.  Not suck

Thank you to all the artists who have shared their Christmas songs on
SoundCloud for the rest of us!

NOTE: I posted this in 2015, backdated to 2013 when I created it because
I wanted an archive of each year.
