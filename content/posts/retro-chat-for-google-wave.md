One of the biggest complaints from first time Google Wave users is the
tidal wave of information and updates that threatens to suck their
precious time away as they watch the chaos unfold.

In a carefully tended wave, the noise and chaos are minimal, but in some
of the larger (public) waves, users have given up hope of ever keeping
on top of it all.

Charles Lehner has created a simple chat gadget that might help calm the
swell, by focussing some of the chat into a form most of us will
recognise: IM. By introducing this gadget to a wave, you can give people
an outlet to speak that brings in years of built up convention for
managing the flow. People **understand** Instant Messaging, so you can
add this gadget to bringÂ  normalcy to the new medium.

Perhaps you could embed this in a wave and encourage people to use it
for idle chitchat, leaving the rest of the wave for the real-time
collaboration on the task at hand.

As with other gadgets the Playback function records every new person who
gets to the chat, and every message, so be aware that this can blow the
size of your wave recording out with a lot of extra updates to wade
through if necessary.
