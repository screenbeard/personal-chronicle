}I love *The Muppet Show* (if the title "greatest show of all time"
didn't tell you that). It had an innocence and irreverence that is
almost completely missing from our TVs today. Jim Henson's creativity is
still missed since his death almost 20 years ago. Three of Henson's
wonderful creations were creatures who could barely talk, yet made us
laugh with a cacophony of squeaks, grunts and pseudo-language that left
us baffled while we let out tears of laughter. They were the Swedish
Chef, Animal, and Beaker.

Here they are in their greatest moment together.
