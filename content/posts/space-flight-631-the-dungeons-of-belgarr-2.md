**Rex clutched the Princess to his chest and leapt from the tower.**

The Professor's new grappling line snapped taut and swung Rex and his
charge in a wide arc around the outside of the tower and back in towards
the lower floor window.

The guards inside had no time to prepare as a million razor sharp shards
of [TITANOGlass](http://geekorium.com/titanoglass) exploded inwards
followed by a powerful figure holding a beautiful woman. Those who
weren't already bleeding on the floor were incapacitated swiftly. Rex
lasered a guard as he reached for his pistol then sent another spinning
with a round-house kick. The remaining guard fell as the Princess sent
him flying into next week with a surprise uppercut.

"That was pretty impressive Your Highness," drawled Rex.

"I didn't want you thinking I needed you to rescue me," replied the
Princess. ((This post was originally published as a subscriber only
