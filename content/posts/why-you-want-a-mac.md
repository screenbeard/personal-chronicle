This post was my response to a [question asked by Ronnie
Swafford](http://ronnieswafford.newsvine.com/_news/2006/05/13/194953-convince-me-to-buy-a-mac "Ronnie Swafford's original question.")
on [Newsvine](http://www.newsvine.com "Newsvine - Get Smarter Here"):
Why was he, a Windows Programmer with no obvious need for a Mac so drawn
to get an Apple computer?

I answered (and am yet to see if he responds), but noticed what a huge
comment I'd written and thought it could be a blog entry in itself. So
here is why you want a Mac.

**You want a Mac** because Apple seems to have a philosophy that says,
"do what must be done to make this a positive, well rounded experience".

It's an interesting idea, and it got people (myself included) to realise
that PC's are holding advances in tech back. Consider this, Apple
ditched numerous PC staples that people relied on, and are only now
realising they don't need:

1.  Out dated peripheral ports (parallel, serial, ps2) choosing USB and
    Firewire alone to connect peripherals - and how much simpler is
    that?

2.  Ditched floppies too. I would rather tech support a Mac than a PC
    for this reason alone...

3.  Said goodbye to System 9. They supported it for a reasonable time,
    but made it clear all along that their system would not be bogged
    down trying to make everyone happy

4.  Have sort of shown that they will use stable, or new and emerging
    technologies (with their own spin on it) instead of insisting that
    people keep using 'updated' (feature-tacked-on) versions of their
    old proprietary technology. Again - System 9 was ditched in favour
    of a nix backbone. They include apache and php with the OS. Compare
    Microsoft who keep loading pile after pile of re-worked re-hashed
    proprietary stuff on the public, locking more and more people into
    'their' system.

Sure these things annoyed some people, but it's clear that Mac's are
'moving forward' while PC's are stuck catering to people stuck in the
past.

All in all, I feel like I'm taking charge when I buy a Mac - no one will
tell me what to I have to use. Of course this isn't always true and I
prefer Firefox because Apple decided I couldn't use the latest version
of Safari without purchasing Tiger. But more often than not, if I see it
coming to a PC in the future, Apple is already doing it.

If Apple pioneers something new (this is hypothetical) I can imagine
that they will use existing standards to make it work securely and
easily, and start to phase out whatever it replaces. If Microsoft or
Dell were to make this hypothetical Doohickyâ„¢ it would use their own
proprietary software/hardware combo, communicate in a completely new and
patentable way, be full of bugs, and contain a bunch of bits and bobs
that make it (theoretically) usable with technology I hated ten years
ago when it was in it's prime, and now isn't used by anyone but my Gran.

You want a Mac because it speaks to you of future world that doesn't
need endless configuration, doesn't rely on and adhere to old tech, and
will move and change easily with the advances of our field.
