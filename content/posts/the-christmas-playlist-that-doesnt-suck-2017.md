I've scoured Soundcloud to find the best Christmas music I could find.
It's chock full of Christmas favourites that are guaranteed to:

1.  Bring Christmas cheer

2.  Not suck

This years playlist includes:

Jingle Bells, Ding Dong Merrily on High, The First Noel, the only
version of Jingle Bell Rock that doesn't make me want to cancel
Christmas, Silent Night, and sixteen more classics reimagined in ways
that don't suck.

The whole [Christmas Playlist That Doesn't Suck
(2017)](https://soundcloud.com/screenbeard/sets/christmas-playlist-2017)
is up on Soundcloud right now, go have a listen!

Thank you to all the artists who have shared their Christmas songs on
SoundCloud for the rest of us!
