Twitter sucks.

It feels good to finally get that off my chest.

Not the users, mind you. I've met some great people through Twitter.
[Bloggers](http://taciturnly.com), [programmers](http://oliyoung.com),
[web designers](http://tarynhicks.com.au), a
[lot](http://zombieskittles.com) of [fellow](http://beaugil.es)
[Adelaidians](http://monnie.com.au). All of them excel at what they do,
go out of their way to try new things, and generally win at life.

But Twitter sucks.

Not the technology either. Mostly. FSM knows I've griped and bitched
about how Friendfeed put it to shame technologically, and in the end it
didn't matter. Twitter does what it does well. No, that's not why it
sucks.

Twitter sucks for the same reason they ALL suck. The same reason
[Friendfeed](http://friendfeed.com) sucks,
[Facebook](http://facebook.com) sucks, [Cliqset](http://cliqset.com),
[Status.net](http://status.net), [Google
Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/) and now
[Buzz](http://www.google.com/buzz) **all suck**.

Because I don't get them.

I mean, I know why they exist. I enjoyed throwing out tweets here and
there. I like connecting with friends and new people. I understand that
they're about sharing what you know and find, and uncovering new stuff.

But they just don't gel with me.

They take time. Energy. Dedication. They require you to put in thought
about what your friends might like to read. You need to watch what you
say about your workmates and avoid sounding stupid. I self censor so
much all my input comes out trite and uninteresting, and when my
internal censor fails I come off self absorbed.

And I can't keep up.

In the period of time I was tweeting the most, I was also working the
least. Work sucked, and that didn't help, but I just wasn't as focussed
as I should have been. ((This post was originally written back in 2010
and was never published because I think I recognised it was unhelpful
whining. I'm publishing it now because it was where my head was in those
days))
