title: Gadget. A fun one
url: /gadgets/

Now I'm rather pleased that I can get myself around Wave, post links to
my photos and generally do all the good stuff.

There are however, people of my acquaintance who are a lot more
technologically 'ept' (it should be a word, you know -  the opposite of
inept) and have started mucking about under the bonnet of Wave.

One of these is Dave, and the other day he introduced me to a little
gadget he calls 5x5.  The object of the game is to totally fill the grid
with black squares. Clicking on a square results in that square (and
those around it as seen in the initial pattern below) toggling its
colour. There is a solution in 14 moves.

I'll hand over to Dave to explain what it is, how it came about,  and
how it works.

*5x5 is a puzzle I first saw as a DOS PC thing back in the late 1980s. I
wrote my own version of it back then (just for fun) and, ever since,
it's sort of been my "try a new environment" project. I've written
versions for DOS, Windows, OS/2, the old* [*Palm
Pilot*](http://www.davep.org/palm/) *and even for* [*GNU
emacs*](http://www.davep.org/emacs/)*.*

*Some time back I quickly wrote* [*a HTML/Javascript
version*](http://www.davep.org/misc/5x5/) *so, given that that's pretty
much all a Wave gadget is, I reworked it as a gadget. The main
difference with this version is that it's coded with the state of the
game held in the Wave. This means that a) you can always come back to it
and it'll be how you left it and b) everyone who is part of the Wave can
see what's happening and can also make moves.*

*All you have to do is use the "add a gadget" toolbar button (the one
that looks like a green jigsaw) and just input this URL in the dialog
that you get: <http://serenity.davep.org/5x5/5x5.xml>*

Hmm - the fun stuff begins!

Oh, and PS ... I couldn't do the puzzle (/grin) not even using Wave's
fabulous "playback" feature!
