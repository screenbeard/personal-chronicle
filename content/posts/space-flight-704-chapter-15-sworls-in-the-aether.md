**Rex focused on his hands.**

He was startled to see that he could... see... them.

"I have hands!" he exclaimed at the other, but *as* he thought he
watched them blur and slide back into the æther.

% \[voiceinthedark\]Before you can return to the mortal
realm,\[/voiceinthedark\] the voice explained, \[voiceinthedark\]you
must master your physical form.\[/voiceinthedark\]%

"How?" asked Rex.

% \[voiceinthedark\]Impose your will on the
universe.\[/voiceinthedark\]%

In the silence, Rex concentrated. He imagined he saw his fingertips, saw
sworls of prints. He watched fingernails form, knuckles, and scars from
a thousand battles. His hands grew in front of him and he flexed them
slightly and felt their strength, their permanence.

% \[voiceinthedark\]You are learning quickly,\[/voiceinthedark\] came
the voice after a hundred years of silence.%

Rex started.

"Huh?" he grunted as he watched his hands explode into nothingness once
more.
