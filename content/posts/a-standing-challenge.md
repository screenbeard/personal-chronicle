}About 6 months ago I read a Lifehacker article that advocated standing
at your office desk to stay healthier. I thought it was a neat idea at
the time but didn't try very hard to make it happen. Then Lifehacker
again [linked to an article in the NY
Times](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/23/stand-up-while-you-read-this/?pagemode=print)
about standing at work, and this time I decided to do something about
it.

Introducing my standing desk

It's two different size filing cabinets which turn out to be exactly the
right heights for my keyboard and monitors. It's surprisingly
comfortable from about my shins up, but my feet are already killing
((perhaps I need more WiiFit to improve my centre of gravity)).

I find it difficult to fit much exercise into my day. Hopefully this
might get me using even a little energy.

PS. Read that article. It's an eye opener, and a very quick read.
