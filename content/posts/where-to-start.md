}Gina Trapani, Adam Pash and the Wave community have put together a short
ebook on Google Wave. I'm certain as Wave becomes more complex and
useful, this guide will grow and change to match. Gina and Adam are two
of the cleverest technology writers on the web today, and their book is
set to become one of the most authoritative documents on Google Wave.
