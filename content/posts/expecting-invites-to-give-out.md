One thing I've been wondering is how we'll get the chance to invite more
people to Wave. I was one of the lucky ones who got in on the first
round, and had invites to share, but those I've invited haven't been so
lucky. Currently my invite counter is sitting at “00” too.

So we'll be seeing this eventually (goodness knows how it's added -
magic fairy dust perhaps), so don't fret - All in good time!
