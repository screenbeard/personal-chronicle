Why can't we all just get along?"

Google has decided to throw its weight behind
[WebM](http://www.webmproject.org/), the new more "open" video format
that competes with Apple's H.264.

In a post a month or so ago, Google announced that future versions of
[Chrome will drop support of
H.264](http://blog.chromium.org/2011/01/html-video-codec-support-in-chrome.html)
in favour of WebM.

Of course, Microsoft wont play ball and build WebM into IE9 (their
upcoming latest browser), prompting Google to create an [Internet
Explorer 9 compatible plugin](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/webmmf) to
enable WebM playback in that browser.

Meanwhile, Microsoft has seemingly put their muscle behind H.264,
announcing **their** Extension for **Chrome** that [enables H.264
playback](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/interoperability/archive/2011/02/01/greater-interoperability-for-windows-customers-with-html5-video.aspx)
in that browser.

So Microsoft is making extensions for Chrome to enable a feature Google
left out, and Google is making plugins for IE that Microsoft left out...
Why aren't they both just working on their own damn browsers?

Thanks to [Google Operating
System](http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2011/03/webm-plugin-for-internet-explorer-9.html)
for the story.
