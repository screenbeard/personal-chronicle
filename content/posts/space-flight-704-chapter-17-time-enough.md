**While the voice explained, Rex began forming his arms.**

"So this Torimbalo is some sort of artefact?" he asked as the voice
finished. "Something that imbues power through what? Touch?"

% \[voiceinthedark\]It is not a physical object, any more than you are
now. The power is normally given by another that wields it, but now the
power has been taken forcefully.\[/voiceinthedark\]%

"Jones found a way to steal something that has no physical form?" Rex
was impressed despite himself.

% \[voiceinthedark\]In a manner of speaking. Because of the nature of
the power some of it was given to you at the moment you left the
physical realm.\[/voiceinthedark\]%

"When I was vaporised you mean? So Jones is not dead either? What does
that mean? You said I have powers, does Jones have powers too? How do I
stop him using them?"

Rex's arms and hands had dissipated with the avalanche of worry that
filled his mind.

\[voiceinthedark\]Do not be concerned,\[/voiceinthedark\] the voice
comforted, \[voiceinthedark\]we have much time.\[/voiceinthedark\]
