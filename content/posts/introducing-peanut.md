}Today is the day. Most of you already know, but today I get to write
about it.

I'm gonna be a daddy. My wife of five years is pregnant and we couldn't
be happier. Our little Peanut (as we're calling him ((Him is non-gender
specific. It's easier to say than he/she)) ) is 12 weeks old already and
due late July.

Here's his latest piccy

Little Peanut

I don't know what it's gonna be like being a dad, or if I'll be any
good. But when I imagine holding my little child for the first time, I
don't care - I just want it to come right now. I'm so excited. ((and I
just can't hide it))
