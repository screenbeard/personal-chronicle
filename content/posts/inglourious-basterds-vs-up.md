A conversation I had with [my sister](http://twitter.com/mygirlbetty)
recently:

Carlynne

have we discussed [inglourious
basterds](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361748/) yet?

me

you mentioned it

Carlynne

You seen it?

me

no

Carlynne

WHY IN THE HELL NOT

me

the next movie we go see will probably be
[up](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1049413/)

Carlynne

WHAT IN THE SHINY FRICK DO YOU WANT TO SEE THAT FOR

NO SCALPING OF NAZIS IN THAT ONE

SEEEEE IIIIIIITTT

me

but, but

it has a baloon house

:(

Carlynne

SCALPING.

OF.

NAZI'S.

me

HOUSE.

WITH.

BALLOONS ON.

Carlynne

ok. ok fine.

lets go over this again however

tarantino has made one of his best films, its funny, ironic, so well
shot its ludicrous, featuring someof the best performances ive seen in a
while and JEWS SCALPING NAZI'S and you have no immediate plans to see
it.

so...

me

One more timefrom the top.

There is this house see?

And it's got BALLOONS on

BALLOONS

And the BALLOONS make the house a floaty-flyey house

Carlynne

oh man. bit of throat hurty from too much laughing.

Extra Value: I asked my sister via text message if I could use our
conversation for a blog post. Her response?

"Do it. Ho."
