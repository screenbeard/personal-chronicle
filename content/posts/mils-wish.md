}I found a fun little iPhone app called Scribble. You use four pen
colours (and there's no erase) to doodle on the iPhone's touch screen.
Mil had a hoot letting out her frustrations on it. The images below are
for Peanut.

The first is Peanut pushing on mummy's cervix. Peanut is upside-down and
cramped.

A little too anatomically correct in my opinion

The next is Peanut after coming out. See, there's plenty of room.

Blue lines = free space (apparently)

Finally, Mil has a picture of herself holding Peanut. A promise of
things to come, if you will.

Please come soon Peanut!

Isn't she a brilliant artist?
