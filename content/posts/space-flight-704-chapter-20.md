**At least his discomfort was gone**

The figure before him was a stranger, but someone vaguely familiar. He
had thought at first he knew him, or was it a her?

Looking away for a second, he could not recall a single distinguishing
feature.

"Who are you?" he asked, looking back.

The other hadn't changed, still looked the same, but Rex still had
trouble recalling him even while staring straight at her.

"\[voiceinthedark\]I am no one I remember,\[/voiceinthedark\]" came the
familiar voice from the unfamiliar source, more resonant and somehow
younger - though still ageless.

"You are a very confusing person," Rex said, turning back to look out
over the sea.
