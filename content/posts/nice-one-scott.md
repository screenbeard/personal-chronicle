<div class="description">

★★★★★ Scott was at the Information desk of the Blackwood branch of the
Commonwealth Bank and was most informative and helpful. He remembered me
by name when I came back later on in the day to complete my business and
had me fixed up very quickly. His obvious knowledge of the ins-and-outs
of his business made the whole experience very pleasant. This
[hReview](http://microformats.org/wiki/hreview) brought to you by the

I was thinking the other day that I have a wonderful way of thanking
someone for excellent service. I can't find any reference to this guy on
the net today, but in the future this might be one of the places that
someone learns about Scott's interpersonal skills. They say that a lot
of employers Google your name before they hire you. There's also a lot
of negative info about people and companies that have screwed people
over. I want to start adding a bit of positive info to the net.

Thank you Scott. I'll be calling your employer to pass on my thanks, but
this review is my way of saying "nice work".

I've included this
'[hreview](http://microformats.org/wiki/hreview "hReview on the Microformats website")'
as a test of the format.
