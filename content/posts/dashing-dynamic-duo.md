I once did a post about the old-old [Batman and Robin Serial](//the.geekorium.com.au/batman-as-youve-never-seen-him/) and took some screen-caps from the episodes. One of them has proven quite popular around the internet and has been used by sits like [Cracked](//www.cracked.com/article/18362_the-7-ballsiest-ways-anyone-ever-quit-their-job/)[^withcheese] for any post that needs a picture of Batman and Robin running.

I wondered why it was so popular, till I realised just how iconic that image is, even if I can't think of a particular example. So after some research, here's a compilation of images of Batman and Robin running from different media.

{{< figure src="https://turbo.geekorium.com.au/wp-content/uploads/batman-1960-movie.jpg" alt="Batman (1966)" caption="Kapow!" >}}

First up is Adam West and Burt Ward running to the UN to save some diplomats from being powdered by their greatest foes. I think they'd gotten stuck in traffic?

I can't find any images from the original comics, but I'll keep my eye out for them and put them up as they come. The closest I could find was this vintage 1966 Japanese comic cover. This is the Adam West era as you can tell by the eyebrows on the cowl[^shops].

Despite the lack of direct comic book proof, I submit this retro t-shirt design, and you tell me if it doesn't trigger a memory of something in your brain. You **know** this is a classic image. If you've come to realise the iconic-ness of the image of the Dynamic Duo running, you can buy [~~this t-shirt~~](//www.truffleshuffle.co.uk/store/mens-running-batman-robin-tshirt-from-junk-food-p-2859.html) and wear it proudly.

Or if that doesn't convince you that Batman and Robin hoofing it is one of pop-culture's most classic images, try this piece from the 2007 Singapore Design Festival. Once glance and you immediately *get* it don't you? Because it's *classic*.

Here they are running in Batman: The Animated Series.

Followed by an awesome wallpaper by BobbyRubio on Deviantart.

{{< figure src="https://turbo.geekorium.com.au/wp-content/uploads/midnight_run_by_barrypresh-d2xx189.jpg" alt="A drawn picture of Batman and Robin running across a rooftop" caption="Midnight Run" attr="by BobbyRubio" attrlink="//bobbyrubio.deviantart.com/art/Midnight-Run-177900921" >}}

The next is Batman and Nightwing, but as Nightwing started out as Robin[^dontstart], I figured it was an homage to the idea and therefore valid.

{{< figure src="https://turbo.geekorium.com.au/wp-content/uploads/batman-hush.jpg" link="//www.amazon.com/Batman-615-Hush-Part-Dead/dp/B000VZUDME" alt="Cover for Batman: Hush with Batman and Nightwing running towards the reader" caption="Batman Hush" >}}

Which leads nicely into this one, which is the New Batman and Robin, who are Dick Grayson (the original Robin nee Nightwing) and Damian Wayne, Bruce Wayne's son[^seriously]. So the image comes full circle to the next generation.

And for gamers, Batman and Robin in the best Batman video game adaptation of all time.

Finally, I leave you with Batman and Robin from the end of Batman Forever movie from 1995.
