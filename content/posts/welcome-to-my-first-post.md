This is it. I'm online. I have a web presence. Yay.\
It's two days after Christmas. I've wanted to get online for a while,
being an IT guy but I've kept not doing it. I suppose I've thought I'm
not interesting enough, and I may not be, but now I don't care anymore.
So I'm here now. So I've spent about 5 hours getting my website setup,
installing and uninstalling different options (as given to me by my
provider).

I've settled on a 'blog' which is totally trendy... It seems the
simplest way to quickly write things as I go, without worrying about
**html** and such. I can use **html**, and I could *possibly* try to
figure out my own **php** based system, but sheesh - I just got my own
website, I don't want to screw around CREATING it now... that would take
ages.

I've installed a Firefox extension called 'Performancing' which I'm sure
is not as amazingly cool for seasoned bloggers as it is for me.

That's it... that's my first entry. I hope it didn't suck so bad. Have a
nice day.
