**The tension broke.**

The Torim above took action. They felt the power from below like
electric prickles on their skin and they could no longer bear it.

They sent armies below, and with fire and plasma and the rending of guns
they silenced the voices in their ears and released the pressure on
their chests.

For a little while at least they even felt relief.
