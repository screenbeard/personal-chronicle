Can you forgive me?

Hi Rex fans ((all three of you))! The last week has been all over the
place for me, with a scheduled holiday from work then the passing of my
Grandma. The week of chapters I had banked up ran out and I didn't end
up publishing anything for Thursday or Friday. I've got new stuff for
Monday though, so prepare yourselves! Spoiler: Rex has hands!

Space Flight 704 - New chapters every weekday at 7pm!
