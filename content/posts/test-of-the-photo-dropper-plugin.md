Checking out the [Photo Dropper Wordpress
Plugin](http://www.photodropper.com/wordpress-plugin/ "Photo Dropper"),
that lets you search for a keyword, and insert creative commons flickr
photos into your posts automagically. I've
[used](//the.geekorium.com.au/hooray-for-on-site-warranties) Flickr
photos in the [past](//the.geekorium.com.au/rules-for-buses), but it's
taken some searching of flickr, and some copy-pasting to get them into
Wordpress. Photo Dropper makes it much easier.

I'll reserve judgement till I've tried it more, but it seems like it
could be very useful.
