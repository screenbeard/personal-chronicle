I've re-enabled comments here at The Geekorium, and imported all my old comments, so go nuts!

I was relying on a script written by someone else, then parsed through a dodgy PHP script I made myself to rename everything into the format my site is relying on, so there might be shenanigans with the imported comments. Please let me know if anything seems off.
