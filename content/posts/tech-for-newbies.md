}I'm gonna try to get a new series going here on the Geekorium where I
answer some of the questions I get asked in my job. I get asked for
advice every day, and it's often more interesting than the sorts of
things I actually do to get paid. Ages ago I toyed with the idea of
making a site where I would break down technical concepts for the less
technically minded, but wasn't sure it would have an audience. The
advice I get asked for though already **has** an audience - the people
that asked in the first place. So when I get asked a question I think
warrants some fleshing out I'll put it under the new category [Tech for
Newbies](/newbie-tech/).

Keep in mind if you're technically minded, that the people I give this
advice to aren't. My answers are simplified and often lacking some of
the stuff us geeks find **very** important. Feel free to point this
stuff out in the comments, but try not to be too harsh on my for leaving
it out! Also sometimes I don't actually **have** an answer - it doesn't
mean I won't try to put them on the right track.

And if you're not a geek maybe I can help you out. Leave a suggestion
(there's a suggestion tab just over there to the right) if you have a
question you think I could answer. Make sure to read what the geeks have
to add though!

The first topic I'm tackling is the age old dilemma - [Should I Buy a
Mac?](//the.geekorium.com.au/should-i-buy-a-mac/)
