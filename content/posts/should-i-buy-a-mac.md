title: Should I Buy a Mac?
url: /should-i-buy-a-mac/

A teacher is after a new laptop, and asked if they should "just buy a
Mac".

A few years ago the answer would have been "absolutely". Not because I
was a Mac fan-boy (I was) but because compared to XP or even Vista, the
Apple operating system and overall computer experience was just much
better. Nowadays my answer is not so clear cut. I told him that of
course "it depends". What's changed?

Microsoft released Windows 7, and slowly pushed itself back to it's feet
to fight another round with Apple.

1.  Win 7 is faster, easier to use and lighter on resources than
    XP/Vista and is just a joy to use.
2.  A standard Dell Vostro ((I know a lot of geeks have problems with
    Dell, but after five years of deploying and maintaining Dells at
    work, I've got nothing but praise)) with an i5 processor, 4Gb
    memory, 500 Gb space and a 15" screen will cost you \$1500 (plus
    \$250 for a three year warranty if you want) . An equivalent Mac
    will cost \$2570 (add \$580 for a three year warranty). That's an
    enormous difference.

Once upon a time, a Mac was harder to compare - they used completely
different technology and the operating systems were chalk and cheese.
Microsoft had effectively stalled for 10 years on the desktop, and Apple
was releasing new features and innovations every couple of years. Now
it's different. I'm just as happy (happier?) on my PC than I was on my
Mac - largely owing to the fact that I could get more power under my
keyboard for the same money.

There are of course still a lot of arguments for the Mac operating
system. Used in conjunction with an iPhone/iPod/AppleTV/Airport it can
seem like magic. The idea that "Macs just work" is still very pervasive
((although I hear horror stories about every computer manufacturer
including Apple so make of that what you will)). At the end of the day
it's about what works for you.

1.  Do you already have a Mac? Maybe get another - the things they can
    do together are sometimes pretty neat.
2.  Do you like top notch industrial design? Macs cannot be flawed for
    how well they're designed and built.
3.  There is speciality software on the Mac that just have no
    competitors on the PC in the same price bracket - software like
    Delicious Library, Transmit, Coda, Rapidweaver. They're all
    wonderfully crafted tools for doing their jobs in simple and
    intuitive ways. I'm yet to find anything that can match any of them
    in style on the PC. Of course, I've found functional alternatives
    (often free) that do the job just as well, but it's
    personal preference.

For me the choice was a lot more simple with the introduction of Win 7 -
I get all the pretty glossy stuff that appeals to the part of me that
likes shiny new things, and the day-to-day management of my computer is
now just as easy as it was on my Mac.
