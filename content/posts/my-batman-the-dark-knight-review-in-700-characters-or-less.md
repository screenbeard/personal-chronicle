I loved the *Dark Knight*. It was fun, but it was also dark and
difficult to watch. The film was experimental (for a comic book movie)
that was a contrast to the big loud and also terrific *Iron Man* a
couple of months ago.

And as for Heath Ledger's Joker, I present my Twitter comments from soon
after seeing the film:

Seriously, he's one scary mofo. I don't want to be Batman anymore.
