Thank you [Beau](http://beaugiles.net "Beau Giles") - your subscription
brings me to 16 subscribers in Feedburner!

Pitiful... Absolutely pitiful

And if that was you that actually clicked on one of my feed items,
you've given me a feedburner "reach" of one! Hooray! I'm popular! I can
use exclamation marks! See?!

On another more serious note,
[Hittail.com](http://hittail.com "link to Hittail - suggestions and statistics for your blog")
suggests that I should be writing about "bible comic strips" and
"allinurl blog"...
