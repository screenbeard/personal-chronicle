I've never met Mo. You might think I'm afraid of him because he's scary
lookin' or because he's a "400ft tall doomsday megabot ((web
developer))" but I'm not. I just haven't had the opportunity yet. He
isn't scary online though - in fact he's quite the opposite. His avatar
shoots laser beams from his eyes, but I'm sure they're laser beams of
joy.

I've followed Mo soon after I joined Twitter. He's one of the more
active Adelaide Twitterers, despite the fact that he's unapologetically
((and understandably)) a Friendfeed fanboy. He's just as active on both
services though, and happily pops in and out of both to carry on
cheerful conversations with his many followers. He's helpful and
talented, and an inspiration with his (rassafrassin) custom workouts. He
tweeted the beginning of his plan to get fit, and has reported huge
successes since, showing tremendous determination.

His [ReactionDynamics](http://reactiondynamics.com/) site showcases his
photography and 3D design work, as well as his impressive resume. It
also contains a picture of Mo with his sweet Abraham Lincoln beard
((Beard buddies!)).

If you wanna follow someone who's well known to both Twitterers and
Friendfeeders alike, who sometimes talks like a robot, has a wicked wit,
and is and all-around overachiever, follow
[@mokargas](http://twitter.com/mokargas). And [on
Friendfeed](http://friendfeed.com/mokargas) too, if that's your thang.
