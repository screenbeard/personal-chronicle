title: When Play School becomes Too Much Play School
url: when-play-school-becomes-too-much-play-school
---

You know your daughter watches too much recorded Play School when, instead of singing **ABCD-FOG**[^1], she sings **ABC-for-kids-on-2**. And I can hear it in my head as she does it.

The ABC might not have advertising, but its sure got some catchy jingles.

[^1]: she doesn't know what the alphabet is yet, cut her some slack
