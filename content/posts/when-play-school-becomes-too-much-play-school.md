title: When Play School becomes Too Much Play School

You know your daughter watches too much recorded Play School when,
instead of singing **ABCD-FOG** ((she doesn't know what the alphabet is
yet, cut her some slack)), she sings **ABC-for-kids-on-2**. And I can
hear it in my head as she does it.\

The ABC might not have advertising, but its sure got some catchy
jingles.
