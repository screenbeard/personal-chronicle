}**I am not an atheist!** I say this because I am about to link to an
article that makes a few excellent points about common Christian
arguments. Before I give you the link I want to stress that I am not
saying that I am an atheist, or that there are no reasonable arguments
for Christianity - only that some don't hold up to scrutiny, and you
must know what won't be convincing to me if you use it as an argument.

Look on this as a way to improve your ministry...

OK, enough disclaimers. Read this article before you argue with me:\
[How Not to Embarrass Yourself in an Argument With an
Atheist](http://www.ooblick.com/text/atheist-argument.html).
