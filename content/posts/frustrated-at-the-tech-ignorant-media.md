Eager to dig up dirt on Julia Gillard (an alumna of Unley High School)
the SMH visited the Unley High website ((designed by moi)) and clicked
on through to the [Old Scholars](http://www.uhs.sa.edu.au/oldscholars/)
page. HAHA! they yell, chuckling to themselves:

> ... it appears the website of the federal Education Minister's former
> school, Unley High, has fallen victim to hackers. No doubt
> coincidentally, those curious to learn more about the Deputy PM's
> school days in South Australia by clicking on the "old scholars" tab
> are confronted with an advertisement for "free black nude pictures"

Of course, the site has not been "hacked" in any way. In setting the
site up, I thought it a fun experiment to give the Old Scholars a way to
re-connect, and create mini sites of their own within the pages of the
Unley site. The hope was that they might create groups for the *chess
club of '94*, or the *lazy boys of the class of '67*, or whatever. Then
they could write messages on each other's pages, write reminiscences of
the times they had, and generally use the site in any way they saw fit
to reconnect and share with one another. I installed the excellent
open-source software [Elgg](http://elgg.org), and enabled a feature
called "blogs" (short for "web logs") so people could fill the pages of
the site with all their memories. I had hoped it would be a long-lasting
record that would share some of Unley's rich history.

'Till the spammers got hold. Elgg is a well-known piece of software, so
spammers have written scripts that scour the web for open installations
of Elgg (such as ours is), automatically create user accounts, and start
writing blog posts promoting their spammy sites. What they are doing is
taking advantage of sites that are open to the public, and is so far
from hacking it's ludicrous. It's no different from me creating a
pretend Facebook account called [Spammy
McSpams](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?ref=profile&amp;id=100000818973289#!/profile.php?v=wall&amp;ref=profile&amp;id=100000818973289)
and posting links to porn from there ((Oh my god I hacked Facebook! Now
lets see how long that account lasts)).

The Old Scholars site has the ability for legit users to flag such
stuff, and I've tried to make it as obvious as possible. My only problem
was presuming people would make use of such features when given. To
prevent such "hacking" in future, I've disabled the blog feature, as no
one was using it except the spammers. I've also cleaned the site up, so
horny journos will need to find some other source of black nudes ((And I
have to say, no one from the Sydney Morning Herald tried to contact us
to make us aware of the problem, so screw them.)).

Just wanted to clear that up.
