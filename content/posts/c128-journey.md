![On it's
way](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/872/26882519227_9cd56c8050.jpg "On it's way")

Here it goes

About 12 months ago I listened to [The C= episode of the Rubenerd
podcast](https://rubenerd.com/show359/) wherein he tried to convince
himself (poorly!) not to buy a Commodore 128.

I got in touch on twitter and asked if he wanted my old C=128 because
although for nostalgia reasons I had held onto both my families old 64
and 128s, having both sitting in a closet doing nothing seemed stupid.

Rubenerd was glad to take it off my hands, and I'm glad it's going to
someone who clearly loves retro computers in a way I will never emulate
((geddit?))

My memories of this thing are playing [Wizball](rem/wizballin/) to the wee hours with my mum, her elation when she finally clocked it, playing Subsunk and
Cosmonaut and River Raid and Curse of Sherwood and so many other games
my young hands couldn't master.

I was never much of a gamer, and I never did put in the hours to finish
all those games I loved, but it did make me love computers and the
potential behind them. I also wish I could say I'd programmed much on
either machine, but copying out code from a book didn't teach me much at
the time, but it did help me see what someone could do with the right
mindset and training, and planted a seed for programming that took
another 25 years to finally grow.

The 64 and 128 have reached a level of nostalgia in my mind that they
possibly don't deserve, but they're the only couple of things from my
childhood that I really remember clearly. That and the
[Chubbles](http://ghostofthedoll.co.uk/chubbles.php) that were clearly
more [gimmick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gRT8mcr8LY) than
substance. Oh, and the [Rubick's Magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's\_Magic) I got one Christmas
and couldn't put down.

Today I finally got off my ass and posted it to Rubenerd. Shipping was
surprisingly cheap because he didn't need the vintage printer or the
after-market disk drive I have for it.

I won't mention the contents, and save that for a surprise for him,
beyond the following:

-   A slighlty rattly Commodore 128
-   A power supply that no longer works, but that Rubenerd assures me he
    can fix or replace

I would love if Rubenerd could post an unboxing when he gets it. I left
a couple of things in there that I hope he doesn't mind receiving and
having to store somewhere. And I'd love it if he could post it to [The
Fleet](https://rubenerd.com/omake/the-fleet/) when he gets it working,
with a suitably cute name. Enjoy it, learn new things on it, and share!
