OK, that's a bit misleading, as I don't in fact love opera as
entertainment. I don't even love it as a web browser. I am however
giving it a shot as my default browser. I had been using Firefox, and
whilst I appreciated the ability to customise it to the n^th^ degree I
was finding it slower and slower for my usual browsing.

So I switched. I may go back, but I like the **speed**.
