[Embedding my first Google Wave into
Wordpress!](http://www.buildcontext.com/blog/2009/06/03/embedding-my-first-google-wave-into-wordpress/)

The problem with embedding waves in blogs - no one can read them if the
service goes down or won't allow you access. Better would be to have the
wave actually publish content to your database. Then a Wordpress plugin
that takes comments written and puts them back into your wave stream
would be necessary. Better would be blog software written on the [Wave
Protocol](//the.geekorium.com.au/wave-the-protocol/).
