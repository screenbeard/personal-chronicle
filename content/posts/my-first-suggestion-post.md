I have that "Suggestions" button up there on the right because I'm
hoping that people might make my never ending search for *interesting*
stuff to write about easier. Before today my only suggestion has been
(literally) "....", which I'm not sure what to do with. I thought it a
stretch to drag a post out of an ellipsis and a period.

Then today I got GOLD.

"mate your a wanker"

Not a suggestion as such. It's entirely possible that the chap ((I
presume its a fella)) misread the tab to read "Statements", and just
decided to put his 2 cents in.

I do have a comment area under each post so if it's a particular thing
I've said, you could leave a **specific** comment. Failing that, you
could contact me directly and say hello. Perhaps after a chat you might
come to realise that I'm not such a bad guy.

I can infer a couple of things about my eloquent visitor:

He spent 10 seconds on my site. Just long enough to write "mate your a
wanker", and pretty much nothing else as far as I can tell. I can't see
exactly how he found my site, which suggests he either bookmarked it to
come back later to insult me specifically, or he came from a secure site
such as Facebook or his email. What he's doing seeing my site in his
email I have no idea.

He's from Manly, NSW but I've never been so don't know what that says
about him. I'll steer clear of geographical stereotypes in this post :P.
He gets a small pass from me for using Google Chrome (the browser of the
gods), but he's using Vista so he is a little backward. And if he ever
comes back I'd like to know if his Vodafone plan is any good...

So that's the post you get for your "suggestion". I hope it satisfies.
Anyone else who has an ACTUAL suggestion is very welcome to write
something up there, and I'll treat you with a lot more respect than I've
treated this one.

Isn't spam fun?
