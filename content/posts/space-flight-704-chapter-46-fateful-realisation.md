}**He'd been a bit of a dick.**

Rex reran his life in reverse and found himself wanting.

He watched his past heroics from a new perspective and decided he didn't
like the man he'd been.

All the mooks he'd killed and the villains he'd slain had been part of a
whole he had no right to alter. The lives he'd destroyed were not, for
the most part, evil. And those that were, not irredeemably so.

He saw that now.
