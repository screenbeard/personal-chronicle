**One by one they were taken.**

In the darkness, they came with powerful lights that blinded. Although
they were met without resistance they brought weapons.

They rounded up a few at a time and they took them above. They opened
them up to see where the power lived and tried to pull it out.

Of course it failed. The power was not caused by any part of their
physical body, unless you count their consciousness or their ever-loving
minds.
