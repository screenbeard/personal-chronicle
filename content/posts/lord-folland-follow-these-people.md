}[Lord Folland of Albion](http://lordfolland.blogspot.com/) (or David as
he was known before he took the throne of Albion in a ~~bloody~~ *muddy*
coup) has been a mate of mine for years. We used to attend the same
church, and had enormous fun making videos together and editing them on
his ~~eMac(?)~~ iMac.

We hadn't caught up in years, until my early Twittering days he found
and followed me. Now I appreciate his incredible intellect (he's a
trained SCIENCE teacher you know), his insight on IT, and his passion
for education and literacy. He's a complex and terrific man.

If you'd like someone in your twitter network who is always encouraging,
a little bit goofy, and all sorts of smart, look no further than
