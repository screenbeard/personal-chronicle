Went to see above-mentioned film on the weekend. First off let me take
the opportunity to say, "Shove over d\#@-head!". The session I went to
was the biggest of the 30 screens on offer, but it was still
overcrowded. Which wouldn't make me annoyed (well not in the same
self-righteous sort of way) except that each group of people decided
that everyone that didn't belong to their little group was smelly or
evil and left **one** seat between them and the next group of
xenophobes.

So my friend and I were forced to split up and sit either side of one
fat guy with a B.O. problem... no, I'm fibbing - we had to sit in the
second row.

Thus begins the discussion of "Pirates of the Caribbean", starring
[Orlando
Bloom](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0089217/ " http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001745/ ")'s
Nostrils, [Johnny
Depp](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000136/ " http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0047549/ ")'s
Mascara, and [Keira
Knightley](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0461136/ " http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0390903/ ")'s...
pores. Don't get me wrong - they're beautiful pores (actually I will say
this for the film - when you're looking up at the pores of a real person
and a CG character and they're equally as detailed - it's good CG), but
no one should be forced to critically analyse an actor's skin because of
another person's ignorance.

So on to the movie.

Seriously. Rant over.

What a ride! It was intense. I cannot tell how much of the dizziness I
experienced was intentional on the part of [Gore
Verbinski](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0893659/ "IMDB Entry for Gore Verbinski")
and how much was my terrible seating (OK, enough now), but it was a fair
spectacle. With stunning computer created creatures, and some terrific
characters. I had heard that Johnny Depp was particularly good in this
(and especially in the second half) - I don't know. Johnny Depp does
some marvellous work, but I just couldn't like Jack Sparrow. In the
first movie I remember liking him a lot, but in this he grated on me -
which made the ending (and you'll understand when you see it)
particularly hard for me to believe.

The story is sprawling. I wasn't aware going in that this is the second
in what will be a trilogy, which gives the writers a lot of room to
create multiple stories. And at three hours for this movie alone, they
jam pack it full of stories. They go this way, they go that way, and
there's sword fighting, comical chases, and Depp doing that girly
running. It's all very good fun, but looking back it's all a bit much.

And knowing that it is a two-parter might help some people deal with
what I saw as the most annoying part of the whole film. After hours of
crazy running and complicated plot twists, and a cast of characters that
could sink a ship (get it?) instead of wrapping up, the film ends.
NOTHING IS RESOLVED. As my mate put it - this is the longest teaser
trailer for a movie ever made (Barring LOTR: FOTR and TT - which at
least wrapped up the occasional sub-plot). It p\#\#d me off that now
I've invested three hours in this movie I'm forced to see the last one.
How did I miss that it was split in two? I don't know.

My mate thoroughly enjoyed himself. That's a good endorsement to me. He
enjoyed it 'cause it followed so well from the original - bringing back
favourite characters, and developing ideas that didn't get fully
explored. Oh, but read up on your pirate myths before you go. The
stories of Davy Jones et al are kind of explained throughout, but with
everything going on you might want to have a better understanding of how
all the stories fit together... My exposure to the story of the Flying
Dutchman is limited to episodes of Spongebob. **And watch part one just
before**. I didn't (can you tell) and I couldn't remember what the hell
anyone was talking about.

Pluses:

-   Very fun

-   Pirates (this may well be enough)

-   Sword-fighting

-   Returning characters

-   Keira Knightley

-   Johnny Depp (if you're so inclined)

-   Fantastic CG

Minuses

-   Long

-   Part two of three

-   Pirates (yes this is a minus for some... they aren't nice people)

-   Keira Knightley's massive chin (it's only in one scene, so it's
    not terrible)

So all up, I give it 24 *'s for being fun. And if you REALLY enjoyed the
first one add another 10*'s, but I'm adding 10 -'s away for not making
it really obvious that it was gonna stop half way thr...
