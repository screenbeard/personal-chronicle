**Rex pounded on the walls of his glass prison.**

Doctor Van de Nippal paced around his command center, chuckling to himself and explaining his plan to his helpless captive.

"So you see Havoc, you are about to be atomised with the very-same death-ray that will turn this planet to dust, and leave my island base a floating asteroid-space-ship with which I can begin my plan to dominate this galaxy!"

Rex stopped banging for a moment and looked the doctor in the eye.

"You won't get away with this. I won't let you."

"But what can you do my dear Havoc? You are trapped in a glass dome made of the same material that will protect my island-cum-asteroid from the cold kiss of space. It is strong enough to keep the death-ray out and keep it sealed in there... with you!"

Rex tried to downplay the small smile that twitched at the corners of his lips.

Doctor Van de Nippal ceased his pacing and came to a stop in front of a giant silver panel covered in dials and switches. His hand hovered over a giant green button in the center.

"With this, I bid you Adieu!" shouted the madman as his finger stabbed down.
