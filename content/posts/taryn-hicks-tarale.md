I know Taryn from her days on the state school ICT helpdesk. She was
very helpful and cheerful (on the outside at least), and willing to work
through stuff over the phone. Then she moved into the section that dealt
with website stuff, got hopelessly frustrated and left for greener
pastures, but not before drafting the guidelines that schools can use to
make their websites meet govt. standards... although most schools don't
((check out http://www.uhs.sa.edu.au for one that does)).

So anyway, somewhere in there we started chatting, and twittering, and
I've come to appreciate her enthusiasm for technology and her artistic
flair. Her knowledge of memes is awe inspiring ((it really is a useful
skill... really)), AND she's [fourth on Twitterholic for
Adelaide](http://twitterholic.com/tarale/)! So she's practically a
celebrity.

She keeps a couple of websites: you can stalk her using this list of
[her website profiles](http://tarale.net/) or check out [her
professional stuff](http://tarynhicks.com.au/).

Follow @Tarale on Twitter if you want to keep abreast of wacky internets
goings on, or need some clever social commentary. Look for the happy (or
sometimes crazy looking) pink bunny.
