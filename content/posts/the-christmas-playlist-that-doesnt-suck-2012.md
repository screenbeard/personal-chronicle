Not your usual Christmas Candy

I've scoured Soundcloud (for literally hours) to find the best Christmas music I could find and my playlist is finally complete. It's chock full of Christmas favourites (and a few new ones) that are guaranteed to:

1. Bring Christmas cheer
2. Not suck[^1]

30 tracks from the likes of Ivy Levan, Swing Republic, Pomplamoose, and Owen Pye. Who are these people you ask? Well, they're all great musicians and they each have a unique sound to bring to your Christmas celebrations. Including favourites like *Away in a Manger*, *Carol of the Bells*, and even the *Theme from Home Alone*.

Over an hour of music, all completely **free** (although Soundcloud lets you buy tracks if you so desire)!

[^1]: There might be **one** deliberately awful track. See if
you can spot it.
