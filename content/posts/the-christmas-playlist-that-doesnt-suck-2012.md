Not your usual Christmas Candy

I've scoured Soundcloud (for literally hours) to find the best Christmas
music I could find and my playlist is finally complete. It's chock full
of Christmas favourites (and a few new ones) that are guaranteed to:\
1) Bring Christmas cheer\
2) Not suck ((There might be **one** deliberately awful track. See if
you can spot it.))

30 tracks from the likes of Ivy Levan, Swing Republic, Pomplamoose, and
Owen Pye. Who are these people you ask? Well, they're all great
musicians and they each have a unique sound to bring to your Christmas
celebrations. Including favourites like *Away in a Manger*, *Carol of
the Bells*, and even the *Theme from Home Alone*.

Over an hour of music, all completely **free** (although Soundcloud lets
you buy tracks if you so desire)!
