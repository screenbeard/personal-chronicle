**It stood to reason that Jones would be unhappy with him. He had shot
him, a lot.**

Then again, Jones had vapourised him from space, so they should be
square. Not to mention Jones had betrayed him in the first place back on
Manasar, and killed The Professor as well. By his count he owed Jones
one.

What worried him now more than Jones finding him and releasing all that
terrible power on him, was what he had been doing with his power before
they'd touched. Jones clearly had a plan when they had gone to recover
the Ortrix, and he wondered if dying had slowed him down at all. Maybe
with all this power he'd have a new plan. Jones always did love a plan.

"What can I do?" he asked the ever-present Presence.
