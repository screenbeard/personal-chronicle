Matt Mullenweg has declared today "[Thank a Plugin Developer
Day](http://wordpress.org/development/2009/01/thank-a-plugin-developer-day/)"
to celebrate Wordpress passing the 4000 plugin mark. Often Plugins are
created for free and have tonnes of hard work put into them for little
or no reward. I currently have 22 plugins active on my website at the
moment handling a variety of functions, but haven't got much time to go
into all the details of who made them and to thank them individually.

Instead, I'll thank one man who made two of the plugins I use: [Joe
Tan](http://tantannoodles.com/). I use his excellent [Flickr Photo Album
for WordPress](http://tantannoodles.com/toolkit/photo-album/) plugin on
two sites and I love it. It integrates seamlessly with Wordpress and
allows me to pull in my Flickr photos into posts and create galleries
from sets. This plugin along with a Pro Flickr account have turned my
crummy blog into a much more wonderful thing. I use it to keep all my
relatives up-to-date with Amelynne's progress as well. Joe also
maintains an terrific plugin to pull files of an Amazon S3 account.

So thank you Joe! Your work and effort are greatly appreciated.

I told Joe that I'd send a donation, but found no way to do it on his
site. When I do, I will!
