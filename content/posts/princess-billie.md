}About a year ago I began writing a story for my daughter Amelynne, using
her toys as characters.

It took me about 3 months to write and 9 months to type it up, and I’ve
finally got something to show for it. Right now it’s still a work in
progress, as I need to read it through a few times with Amelynne and
make sure she’s happy with it. I also need to add some illustrations.

I’d be interested to know what you think. Let me know if you notice\
anything wrong too.
