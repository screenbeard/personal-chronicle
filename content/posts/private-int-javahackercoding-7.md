I may have skipped one there I think. Class was good this last week. I had a look at the example code we were given for the last hand up I did, and used it to properly break my long code into methods.

I don't think I've quite reached that "click" moment that people say will come, but it was nice to finally get that a class can be handled in the same way as the less complex data types, ie you can pass a class to a method, and assign place-holder classes like you can with any `int` or `String`. So you have something like this:

```java
private static Unit rentUnit(){
    Unit unitToRent = unit1;
    return unitToRent;
}
```

Which should be obvious, but I didn't get it until this week. So that was my big moment, and I wasn't sure it had sunk in, but then I began the first part of our major assignment, and knew I'd got it when I was setting up my constructors and throwing classes around like they were any old `boolean`...

So yay for me! I'm actually finding the first part of this assignment too easy, and would have liked it a bit harder so I could properly test myself. But I'll take it easy and learn it slowly so I get it properly. I really want to do this right the first time.
