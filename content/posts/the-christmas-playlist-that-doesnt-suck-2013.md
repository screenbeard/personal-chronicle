I've scoured Soundcloud to find the best Christmas music I could find.
It's chock full of Christmas favourites (and a few new ones) that are
guaranteed to:\
1) Bring Christmas cheer\
2) Not suck

25+ tracks from great musicians with a unique sound to bring to your
Christmas celebrations. Including favourites like "Away in a Manger",
"Carol of the Bells", and even a special rendition of an old favourite
from a much beloved Star Wars character!

Thank you to all the artists who have shared their Christmas songs on
SoundCloud for the rest of us!

I wanted an archive of each year.
