> “…developers have asked us a lot for a market place where we’ll help them sell their extensions to our users including a revenue share so we’ll also make some money from it. “I’ll be very surprised if we don’t go down that route.” - [Google Wave to have application store | News | TechRadar
UK](http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/google-wave-to-have-application-store-644809)

This will be a very important development in the success of Wave. The
iPhone has grown enormously by making high quality apps simple to pay
for and receive. The key difference for Wave will be that the protocol
is open for anyone to extend, and the main client (the Google Wave
interface) is web based.

I predict this will mean a lot more extensions will be made open source
or free. Of course it’s highly dependent on the quality and user
experience of the store. If a developer can make an extension open
source, but still make it available in the same marketplace many will
choose to do so.

Keep in mind too, that over time other clients will emerge that will
access the Wave protocol, and it will be interesting to see if the
marketplace will extend to such clients.
