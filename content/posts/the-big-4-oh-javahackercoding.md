So I have neglectfully not blogged since my update during class last
week. All week I was thinking I had already. When my mum ((hello mum!))
said she'd read my site and hoped class would get better for me I
realised the impression I had left you with was still that I had no idea
what was going on, and it was all over my head.

Thankfully that is not the case! Last week I discovered that I'm right
on track, I'm keeping pace with my class, and I'm **thoroughly**
enjoying myself. Working through some problems on Monday and Tuesday
night was a blast, and I'm really enjoying what I'm learning. That said
I hit a roadblock when the final problem asked me to create a sort of
menu system for creating and updating the details of housing units. In
class last week we covered *if* statements, and this week *loops*, so I
don't feel at all bad about leaving the problem till this week, as I'm
pretty sure the best way to handle the menus is with loops.

On the other hand, I'm not certain the best way to structure things. I
could whack the whole code into the main method, and play it like a
batch file, or I could fumble about a bit and try breaking the code into
classes/methods and seeing how that goes. One way I know will work, the
other is the right way... So I've put it off for homework this week and
hopefully I'll get enough into my head tonight to help push me the right
way.

So no code examples this week. I suppose I could chuck something in
here, but they're all getting mighty long (and who's reading it
really?), even to do the simplest tasks.

Thank you everyone who's been commenting and answering my silly
questions. It's all really helpful, and makes me feel like I'm becoming
a part of the programming community!
