**Pain!**

Ripping and tearing, it unfocussed his mind and he cowered under the
onslaught.

He tried to withdraw, but the Jones-thing held him and was slashing and
rending and he could not escape, was not able to run and the talons went
through him and he tried to cover his body with his hands but he had no
body only mind-stuff and it hurt and spears pierced his present and
began to seep into his past - a river of blood and fire winding its way
back into what he had been, and the claws kept slashing at his breast
and the fangs ripped his innards and white hot pain filled his senses
and he whimpered at the hatred that crushed him and tried to extinguish
him...

A voice spoke to him and calmed him. It wasn't a voice he recognised, if
only because his rational brain was being eaten, but it touched him and
he knew it, and for a single moment he could focus and realised he could
fight back.
