<span class="update"><span class="date">Update: 2007-12</span> My feed
is superceded by the ACTUAL OFFICIAL [triple j: new music
podcast](http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/listen/free_mp3s.xml). Please
subscribe to it! It includes links to the actual MP3s.</span>

<span class="update"><span class="date">Update: 2008-08-29</span> I've
deleted the feed from Feedburner, as it's no longer necessary.</span>

[Triple J](http://triplej.net.au/ "Triple J"){.zem_slink} (an Australian
youth radio station) has been putting free music up on their site for
years for people to download in MP3 format. They don't really seem to
have a way of telling people when new music is up there though.

Well today I found a use for the wonderful [Feed43](http://feed43.com/)
service that's been sitting in my bookmarks folder, and I've created a
~~simple feed~~ that should keep track of the new music as it's posted.

I'm making the feed public with this disclaimer: I don't own the music
and have nothing to do with the Triple J website. Use it at your own
risk. If it breaks I reserve the right to not fix it. If I am told to
stop it by Triple J I will. I have not included a direct link to the
music to avoid as many issues as possible - please visit the Triple J
website to download the songs.

Otherwise, I hope you find it useful!
