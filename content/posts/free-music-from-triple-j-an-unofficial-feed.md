**Update: 2007-12** My feed is superceded by the ACTUAL OFFICIAL [triple j: new music podcast](http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/listen/free_mp3s.xml). Please subscribe to it! It includes links to the actual MP3s.

**Update: 2008-08-29** I've deleted the feed from Feedburner, as it's no longer necessary.

[Triple J](http://triplej.net.au/ "Triple J") (an Australian youth radio station) has been putting free music up on their site for years for people to download in MP3 format. They don't really seem to have a way of telling people when new music is up there though.

Well today I found a use for the wonderful [Feed43](http://feed43.com/) service that's been sitting in my bookmarks folder, and I've created a ~~simple feed~~ that should keep track of the new music as it's posted.

I'm making the feed public with this disclaimer: I don't own the music and have nothing to do with the Triple J website. Use it at your own risk. If it breaks I reserve the right to not fix it. If I am told to stop it by Triple J I will. I have not included a direct link to the music to avoid as many issues as possible - please visit the Triple J website to download the songs.

Otherwise, I hope you find it useful!
