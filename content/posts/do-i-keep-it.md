My good friend Elle has started a product review site called [Do I Keep
It?](http://www.doikeepit.com). The site covers an assortment of
products under broad categories such as "[Health and
Beauty](http://www.doikeepit.com/reviews/health-and-beauty/)",
"[Pets](http://www.doikeepit.com/reviews/pets/)", and "[Technology and
Entertainment](http://www.doikeepit.com/reviews/technology/)".

The site is new, and has only been semi-officially launched, but she's
working hard on it. The reviews are short and well written, and kinda
cute. For example, her first review (and my favourite) is for [Coles
brand Bathroom
Wipes](http://www.doikeepit.com/review/coles-bathroom-wipes/household/),
which I'm fairly certain has **never been reviewed ever before** - so,
you know ***world exclusive!***

I've also written a guest review for the site for [PaperClip Stapleless
Staplers](http://www.doikeepit.com/review/paperclip-stapleless-stapler/household/),
and Elle was kind enough to publish it. I hope to write more for the
site in future. I also have to say ((full disclosure here)), I CAME UP
WITH THE NAME HOW AWESOME AM I?!
