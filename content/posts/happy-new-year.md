Hope you all had a great 2005. I had an average year, with some really
great things, like being given a job at a great place I love to work,
and some not so great things. At Christmas lunch with the family I was
made to score my year, and I gave it a P1 (pass).

Rules if you want to grade your year:

-   no separate grades for areas of your life. Must be one
    overall grade.

-   no fluffing about.

Mil gave hers a pass (P2). No one Failed their year this year, which is
a good sign. I've noticed that people who travelled this year gave their
years High Credits and Distinctions. Must do that myself some day.

Here's to an even better 2006 all round.
