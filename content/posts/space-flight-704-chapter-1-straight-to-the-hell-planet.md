**Rex holstered his gun.**

It was unfortunate that he'd been forced to fire on his old friend, but
to learn he'd been lured by Jones into a trap... Let's just say their
friendship was over.

He'd need to think fast though - even one shot from his Corral Specials
was usually enough to draw the attention of the dopiest of guards.
Twenty rounds was sure to bring the entire security force straight to
him.

"Good," said Rex Havoc to his old dead buddy, "I like a challenge."

With that, he sprinted off down a corridor.
