**Rex *really* didn't know this time.**

Usually when Rex Havoc was tortured for information he'd scoff at their
attempts to draw out the location of the secret base or superweapon or
princess.

He'd laugh and say, "Each time you hit me it makes your death a little
more certain."

Rex didn't know what to say this time. They kept asking him about "the
power of the Torimbalo" and he'd never heard of it. It certainly wasn't
what he came here for. If he wanted to survive this time though he would
have to fall back on his regular routine.

Ignoring his questions Rex growled, "Keep hitting me boy. It makes my
decision of who to kill first much easier."
