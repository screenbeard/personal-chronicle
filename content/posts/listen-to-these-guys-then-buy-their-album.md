I'll be purchasing Caravan Palace ASAP. I've found a group that embodies the music I love. Apparently it's called Electro Swing. I haven't heard a single one I haven't liked yet.[^1]

[^1]: Originally this post had an embedded Grooveshark song or playlist, but I can't be certain which since Grooveshark isn't up anymore. Instead I've embedded one of their videos.
