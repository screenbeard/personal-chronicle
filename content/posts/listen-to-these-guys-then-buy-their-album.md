}I'll be purchasing Caravan Palace ASAP. I've found a group that embodies
the music I love. Apparently it's called Electro Swing. I haven't heard
a single one I haven't liked yet. ((Originally this post had an embedded
Grooveshark song or playlist, but I can't be certain which since
Grooveshark isn't up anymore. Instead I've embedded one of their
videos.))
