Waveboard is an app for the Mac (and coming soon for iPhone) that puts
Google Wave into it’s own application window. Observant readers might
recognise that this is not really all that different from using
[Fluid](http://fluidapp.com/) or [Prism](http://prism.mozillalabs.com)
to create a stand-alone site-specific window. Links from the site
suggest it is related to [Mailplane](http://mailplaneapp.com/), a
similar concept for Gmail.

Additionally, the demonstrated iPhone application seems to be no
different from what Google has already made possible simply by
bookmarking your Wave page to the home screen.

If however you don’t wish to worry about setting something like this up
yourself you may wish to give it a try.

Waveboard is free software (at time of writing).
