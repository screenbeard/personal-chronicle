Huff and Puff and Blow the Pig Down

Tonight is my five year anniversary of this Blog. It started out as Josh
Nunn's Wee Blog on nunnone.com, and tonight - in honour of my
achievement and due to my name-change earlier this year, I've migrated
to this new domain ((Please update your feeds![]()))

The Geekorium is now officially at https://the.geekorium.com.au

The last five years have seen a lot of changes here. I no longer write
much about [religion](//the.geekorium.com.au/category/blog/religion/)
any more, I've started doing some
[videos](//the.geekorium.com.au/category/video/) posts and I've made
numerous cosmetic changes over the time ((and there might be some
glitches while I sort out the latest ones)).

I've had a kid, I've started a new job, and bought a house.

I wonder where I'll be in another five. Hope you stick around!
