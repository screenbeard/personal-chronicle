I'm between Wedding and Reception for my best friends Anna and Andrew,
the most excellentest people I know. They matched each other up there at
the front of the Chapel, and I don't just mean that one wore black and
the other wore white. I mean that they look **good** together. They
really are both terrific, and couldn't be more perfect for each other. I
wish them both the best. And I hope they make it through the rest of the
day. Yahoo tells me its a top of 33˚C today and the abc **LIES** and
tells me 24˚C, and frankly, I'm not inclined to believe anyone who says
it's less than 37... So yeah they would be **hot**. And I'm looking
forward to the reception. Who doesn't love a reception?

My wife and I have been waiting for these two to get married since about
a week after they started dating, and most of the time we keep
forgetting they aren't. So I'm not sure how much will change... for us
(I'm **hoping** things might be slightly different for them!)

So whoever you are reading this, charge a glass and join me in a
cyber-toast to the coolest couple in the world, Anna and Andrew!
