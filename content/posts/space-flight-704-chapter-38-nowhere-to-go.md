**Rex Havoc was afraid**

In his past life he had thought he knew fear. He had laughed at it, even
believed himself above it. He had mocked fear, and those who let fear
dictate their actions. But what he thought was fear was just adrenaline,
the rush of the unknown - and deep down he had embraced it. To a man who
believed himself immortal, what was fear? Surely nothing could harm a
man who was better than any other man alive?

Now he understood that what he thought was fearlessness was just
arrogance, and it was only his connection to the Ortix now that had
given him *true* immortality.

But now he was deathly afraid.

The word scarcely conveyed the full range of the emotion. Fear, terror,
merciless abject horror - these were inadequate expressions for this
feeling.

He wondered if the absence of fear before he became immortal made this
new fear more distinct, but knew to his core that this gnawing, clinging
dread that immobilised him was warranted.

Intellectually, Rex knew himself to be one of the most powerful forces
in existence, but he felt helpless and small. Jones was out there - a
being just as powerful and full of hate. Bonded to existence by the
Ortrix, able to do anything Rex could do, but not bound by understanding
or hindered by compassion. Jones was his final task, his only real
obligation now.

And Rex was petrified.

He calmed his mind and reached out.
