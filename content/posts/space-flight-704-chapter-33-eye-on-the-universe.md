**Rex took the hint.**

He'd stopped worrying about time and let the other teach him about his
powers.

Rex was getting the hang of intergalactic travel. Now with just a
description of the place from his companion, he was able to reach out
with his mind and find it. Then it was a simple matter to pull himself
through into the real world at just the right place.

Of course he was very careful not to let his mind wander anywhere near
that constant *drip-drip* of power that came from Jones.

He also refused to unmake anything and he couldn't tell if this made his
mentor pleased or disappointed. Whenever he reached out to an object to
understand it, he learned it to it's core and knew he *could* unmake it,
but in that instant knew he never could.

It all felt like stretches and warm-ups though. The things he used his
power for didn't seem to have much purpose beyond practice and he
wondered what the end game was meant to be. He did notice a common
thread though. Everything he did increased his awareness of the
universe, how things fit together.

He was feeling pretty smart.
