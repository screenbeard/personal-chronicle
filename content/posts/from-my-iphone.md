A quick obligatory post using the new Wordpress iPhone app. Useful, and might mean more frequent personal posts. Missing [Zemanta](http://www.zemanta.com "Zemanta ltd.") and the [Flickr Photo Gallery plugin](http://www.tantannoodles.com/toolkit/photo-album/) for quick links and Flickr integration. Can't seem to easily link to those two useful tools for instance. I might use it to post about things in the "real world" as they happen.
