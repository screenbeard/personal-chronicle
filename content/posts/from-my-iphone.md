A quick obligatory post using the new Wordpress iPhone app. Useful, and
might mean more frequent personal posts. Missing
[Zemanta](http://www.zemanta.com "Zemanta ltd."){.zem_slink} and the
[Flickr Photo Gallery
plugin](http://www.tantannoodles.com/toolkit/photo-album/) for quick
links and Flickr integration. Can't seem to easily link to those two
useful tools for instance. I might use it to post about things in the
"real world" as they happen.
