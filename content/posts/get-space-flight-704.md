Found an old copy in the attic

[Only last week](//the.geekorium.com.au/space-flight-704-the-book/) I
published the Time Diversion story arc from Rex Havoc's adventures over
[on Amazon](http://amzn.com/B00718SIHQ). Today I'm uploading [the first
ten chapters of the main
story](//the.geekorium.com.au/tag/final-flight-of-xarnash/) [up on
Amazon too](http://amzn.com/B0075S9BUK)!

Amazon wouldn't let me offer it for free, so I'm offering it here too
for anyone to download as Mobi for kindle, ePub for other eReaders and
iDevices and PDF for everyone else.

### Did someone say free?

[Space Flight 704: Final Flight of Xarnash](http://amzn.com/B0075S9BUK)
is available in

-   [ePub for iPad and
    eReaders](//turbo.geekorium.com.au/ebooks/Final-Flight-of-Xarnash.epub)
-   [mobi version for
    Kindle](//turbo.geekorium.com.au/ebooks/Final-Flight-of-Xarnash.mobi);
    and
-   [PDF](//turbo.geekorium.com.au/ebooks/Final-Flight-of-Xarnash.pdf)

Of course, if you have a Kindle, and need a quick way to get your Rex
fix, you can visit Amazon and purchase it there.

Thank your for reading. Please take it and tell your friends.

<span class="update">[Space Flight 704: Time
Diversion](http://amzn.com/B00718SIHQ) is also free for a limited time
on Amazon</span>
