}I got my first comment today by a non-friend non-family member. Can't
tell if it's just spam or not though, and I'll delete it soon (partly
cause Mil's not happy with it).

It got me checking my site statistics though, and I actually get
visitors! It's a very good feeling for someone who thought he'd never be
read. Ever.

People have visited from the [Dilbert
Blog](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/), where I've commented a couple of
times, and from [Quick Online Tips](http://pchere.blogspot.com/). Hello
people from there! The bulk of my outside traffic is from search engines
(Google particularly), and some pretty weird search terms.

'Josh Nunn' is the top Google spot, and I'm not sure who's been looking
for me that way (hello Dad?) or if they've been googling their own name
like I do from time to time - Hello all Josh (or Joshua) Nunn's of the
world. Whoever you are leave comments, as I love knowing that I'm not
the only person reading my thoughts.

This site is about tenth on Google for 'The Streets of Ashkelon', the
short story that prompted my [last
entry](//the.geekorium.com.au/faith-v-religion/ "Godblog entry prompted by 'The Streets of Ashkelon'"),
and a long ramble about God.

I was hit a lot by people looking for info about [Google's error
message](//the.geekorium.com.au/outrage/ "Post about Google's virus alert"),
which seems to be a bit more talked about than it was a month ago.

I also can't spell earthquake (or eath-quake as I have spelt it in the
past) and have been visited by another such spelling disabled buddy from
Google.

Lastly, someone searched for 'josh wee'. What?\
What?\
Why?\
Huh?

Josh Wee. A band perhaps, or a brand of deodorant? But I'm first on
Google for THAT particular phrase... yay...

So that's my day made. I feel so happy.

But please, if you're going to proposition me, don't do it on my
publicly accessible web site.
