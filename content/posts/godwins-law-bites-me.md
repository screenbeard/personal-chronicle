}The day after reading about [Niniane's brush with Godwin's
Law](http://niniane.blogspot.com/2007/11/and-then-he-forced-me-to-leave-room.html "Niniane's Blog: and then I was obliged to leave the room"),
I had my own internal conversation cut short by it...

[Godwin's
Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law "Wikipedia: Godwin's Law")
states that

Now, when someone does make the comparison to Hitler their opponent is
declared the winner and the discussion is over.

Well, sadly I invoked Godwin's Law on myself today. I was thinking about
how weird it is that I used to be so certain that I would always be a
Christian. I made promises to God that I would always be His, so certain
that no hardship would ever make me doubt Him.

I tried to think of other situations where kids have made promises that
might have been misplaced. That's when I thought of the Nazi's and their
brainwashing. Then I had to invoke Godwin's Law and exit my own
conversation. You know how humiliating that is?
