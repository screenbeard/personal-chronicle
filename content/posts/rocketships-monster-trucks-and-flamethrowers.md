Totally manly.

Totally.

So anyway, I made cupcakes today. To be fair I live with two girls, so I
did it for them ((I DID!)). [Monnie](http://vanillasilence.com/) is
running a [Cup Cake Camp](http://cupcakecamp.pbworks.com/Adelaide) soon,
and being the chef of the family felt like I would probably end up being
the one to make cupcakes for it, so I thought I had better practice.

Then [Elle showed off her baking
skills](http://taciturnly.com/2009/09/i-think-i-like-to-bake), and
Twitter is [talking about
it](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=cupcakes) non-stop, so being the
sheep I am ((twheep?)) I jumped on the bandwagon.

And I gotta say, if you make your cupcakes right, they are **awesome**.
None of this lemon icing crap, or straight vanillaboringpants flavour. I
made mine with 70% cocoa chocolate cherry ripes, 70% cocoa chocolate
ganash icing, and glace cherries on top...

So I don't care if it's not totally manly. They were totally tasty, and
I'm totally in Mil's good books for making them.

And if you're nice to me I'll make them again (or something similar) for
Cup Cake Camp Adelaide!
