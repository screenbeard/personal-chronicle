**He'd have to thank The Professor.**

Every mission, it was usually The Professor's neat inventions that got
him out of his predicaments. At least the minor predicaments anyway - he
usually still had to disarm the bomb or kill the leader or steal the
jewels.

Not this time though. They had come on a mission set up by Jones. When
Jones had turned on him, the mission no longer mattered. Now he needed
to return to base and fill The Professor in.

A thought struck him, "What if The Professor has turned as well?"

He brushed the thought aside. The Professor had helped him, just then to
escape. Besides, he had more immediate things to worry about, such as
the fresh hoard of guards bearing down on him.

"Yearrgh!" he yelled as he lept towards them, guns blazing.
