title: The Christmas Playlist That Doesn't Suck (2018)
---

I've scoured Soundcloud to find the best Christmas music I could find. It's chock full of Christmas favourites that are guaranteed to:

1.  Bring Christmas cheer
2.  Not suck

This years playlist includes:

Jingle Bells, a version of All I Want for Christmas Is You that doesn't make me want to murder someone, an original track by Sia, and many more classics reimagined in ways that don't suck.

The whole [Christmas Playlist That Doesn't Suck (2018)](https://soundcloud.com/screenbeard/sets/christmas-playlist-2018) is up on Soundcloud right now, go have a listen!

Thank you to all the artists who have shared their Christmas songs on SoundCloud for the rest of us!
