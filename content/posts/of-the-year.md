}This post was going to start out negative, calling for nominations for
"Unaustralian of the Year". And whilst typically Australian, its not a
particularly celebratory way to see the year out.

So instead I want to spend December gathering stories about people who
have been exceptional this year. I want to know about the hard working
mums who are cooking dinner, washing clothes and potty training a 2 year
old all at the same time, every day.

Tell us about the guy at the end of your street who climbed up a tree to
save a cat and saw an old lady having a heart attack while crossing the
street, so he rushes down and sprints to her side to carry her to
safety, call 000 and start resuscitation, all before that lout in the
Ute comes this close to driving over her face.

Introduce the people near by you who make your life excellent, or who
help people they don't know, or who generally deserve a medal, but
medals are expensive and not given out by a General for "Valor in the
Face of Interrupted Sleep".

Share with us how people you know have been beautiful, hard working,
loyal, brave, inspiring or delicious.

I want you to write a comment to nominate someone you think deserves a
mention for being Bloody Good Bloke or a Top Sheila. Tell us why they
deserve it. Then, if you read a story from someone that you like, give
the comment a thumbs up so I can come back and post about the people you
vote for.

Lets end this year on a positive note, giving thanks for the people in
our lives who inspire us, make us happy, or put others before
themselves.
