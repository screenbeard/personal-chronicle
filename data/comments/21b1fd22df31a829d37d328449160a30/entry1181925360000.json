It IS very basic (and only works in Internet Explorer) - it seems limited to adding sticky notes to pages, not targeted annotation like Jump Knowledge. Really, it might be useful to teachers, but isn't really anything like a page annotator - plus the language on the front page makes it seem geared towards a very select group of people (with large scale group projects).","email":"d5dff3f4ad8eb3cd8bf83da7335bb98d","_id":"098c4e00-4334-11e9-b920-9f6e6053b944"}
