I would imagine that your use of an extension (they are hosted, usually on appspot) would be tied to your login\/domain. It might add some overhead to check each time you used an extension or\nadded a bot, but it could be done. I'm not sure exactly how it would work, but I'm certain they're already working on making it possible.","email":"754cf072d8d20240020e1bd6c8b2be7c","_id":"08abff26-4334-11e9-b05d-b7a21812415a"}
