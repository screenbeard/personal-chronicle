Thank you for your kind words.\n\nOn that 'purines' idea (I had to <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Purines\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikipedia <\/a> it)\n<blockquote cite=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Purines\">\nPurines are found in high concentration in meat and meat products, especially internal organs such as liver and kidney. Plant based diet is generally low in purines.\n\nExamples of high purine sources include: sweetbreads, anchovies, sardines, liver, beef kidneys, brains, meat extracts, herring, mackerel, scallops, game meats, and gravy.\n\nA moderate amount of purine is also contained in beef, pork, poultry, fish and seafood, asparagus, cauliflower, spinach, mushrooms, green peas, lentils, dried peas, beans, oatmeal, wheat bran and wheat germ.<\/blockquote>\n\nMil eats nothing from the \"high\" group already, but eliminating the \"moderate\" group would remove pretty much the rest of her diet: spinach, asparagus, poultry, mushrooms, lentils, beans and oatmeal. We couldn't do it.","email":"d5dff3f4ad8eb3cd8bf83da7335bb98d","_id":"08ba2614-4334-11e9-9b39-cff73f5e2da7"}
