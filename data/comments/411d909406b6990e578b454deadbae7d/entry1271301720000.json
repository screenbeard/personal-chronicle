Do you mean that the wave stays in that person's \"inbox\/bin\" etc. indefinately, or are you referring to spammers setting up wave servers?\n\nIf you mean that the wave stays in their account, then it does not solve spam, as the user can just register a new account once they are done.\n\nIf you mean that spammers will host spam waves on their own servers, then this would stop them spamming completely, as that spam wave would be held on their server, and if they removed it from their server, no-one could access it.","email":"37058133e446e8429c61b3937ec5c1ac","_id":"090b3a68-4334-11e9-b418-9fb2a7d2150f"}
