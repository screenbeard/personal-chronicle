If they use free providers (which is I presume what you mean in the first example), the provider will hopefully have strict limits in place that will flag high levels of waving as possible abuse. Unlike email, once their account is suspended, the wave that was sent will be a lot easer to identify as spam by the recipient (now, once an email is sent, it&#39;s gone and suspending a spammer account makes no difference).","email":"754cf072d8d20240020e1bd6c8b2be7c","_id":"090ca52e-4334-11e9-90b0-6b65635354fc"}
