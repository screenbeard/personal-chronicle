You could see the cracks back then, but they are now chasms. There are no easy answers I think.\n\nWe need a time of experimentation and risk taking. We need to be willing to make mistakes if we are to move forward.\n\nParents like Matt's mother are the new hope for education. While parents remain ignorant and easily swayed by sensationalism in the media their children will continue to get the education their grandparents received. Those children will succeed in our post-post-modern world inspite of their horse and carriage education not because of it.","email":"d7fffeb682073a2cfb76e7114e6b08d8","_id":"09462d3a-4334-11e9-b627-07bf3e1e53a3"}
