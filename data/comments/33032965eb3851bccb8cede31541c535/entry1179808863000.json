I definitely agree with you...and not just because of all the awesome things you wrote about Matthew (and me too!).\n\nComputers, and of course the internet, are such a vital part of my everyday life, that I can't imagine not opening up that avenue for my kids. My daughter, who will be four, is already very good at navigating around some select sites - with adult supervision, of course. My 6 year old niece is learning Photoshop. She's pretty darn good at it too!\n\nKeeping kids from all that technology has to offer is doing them a great disservice. Allowing them to fumble through learning about the internet themselves dangerous. I aim to help my children learn to navigate the waters of the internet safely and proficiently.\n\nThank you so much for the links.\n\nMel","email":"7f6d68c6ce8d197d79ae2f4657d6b7e2","_id":"0947172c-4334-11e9-923b-b745148ca61d"}
