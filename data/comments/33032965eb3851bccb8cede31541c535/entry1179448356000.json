The time for experimentation and risk taking is slowly happening I think, but it's still only the fringe that are doing it.\n\nEducators have been jaded by the promises of technology that has not really delivered or made their lives easier as promised, and they no longer believe it any more. A few teachers can see the potential themselves and are asking for the technology, but mostly they don't want to be fooled again.\n\nAs for the bigger organisation of 'education', it's going to be a lot harder to convince 'the powers' to take the risks they have to take.\n\nI agree about Matt's mother. My fascination with this family started when I read about him at thesneeze.com.\n\n<blockquote>Before you start wondering if a 9-year-old kid should really be reading The Sneeze, his mom just started reading select sections to him (cleaning it up here and there).<\/blockquote>\n\nIsn't that dedication to your child's education right there? And as you've said, our kids will educate themselves in this if they have to, but what wisdom we might pass on will be lost if we don't participate.","email":"d5dff3f4ad8eb3cd8bf83da7335bb98d","_id":"0946c5a6-4334-11e9-b410-e32cdbf454bc"}
