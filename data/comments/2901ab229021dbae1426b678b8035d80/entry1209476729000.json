I don't know anyone that would use these arguments to prove the existence of God to an atheist.  For starters it can't be done.  But statements such as ``Millions have found purpose in life through Jesus. Their lives have been enriched beyond measure by the Bible.''  are not offered as proof, but simply as a worthwhile outcome of belief, when an atheist attacks the 'futility' and what he sees as the harm done by Christianity.  That other religions offer such enrichment is beside the point.  This statement is not offered as proof for Christianity.<br><br>Surely few would argue that ``The Bible is thousands of years old. There must be something to it, for it to have survived that long!''  This would be offered as an argument only by someone that has not thought about it at all, and would not be used in the area of Christian apologetics.<br><br>Pascal's wager is also nothing to do with proof of the existence of God,  but like all of this bloke's assumptions, is a poor example, and would not be used as such by any thinking Christian.  There are truths contained in much of what is said in these statements, but they surely would never be used as any kind of proof of God's existence.<br><br>His last argument about prayer is just silly","email":"e4f62215fa112076e37086588bcee1fb","_id":"094d7d06-4334-11e9-ac23-4f50d66e4439"}
