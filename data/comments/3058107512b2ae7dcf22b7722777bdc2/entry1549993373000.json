It's fairly simple to format, and shortcodes make plugging things in different places super smooth.\r\n\r\nThen if I want to switch things around, there's a simple drag&amp;drop feature in the editor for the different blocks.\r\n\r\nIt definitely breaks a lot of older plugins :( so I get why it's less than appealing too.",
