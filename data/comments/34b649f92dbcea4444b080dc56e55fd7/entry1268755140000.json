At the very least you can discuss AND showcase what you're talking about at the same time.\nI've considered putting a facebook fan widget on my blog, if only for the lulz. I doubt any of the \"fans\" I have really actually read what I write through that, but it's something for fun.\n\nAs an added thing, did you see books are already being released by apparent experts of Wave, even though Wave is still technically in it's infancy still?","email":"41577a138df85c1f52eb44de1671a584","_id":"08d1cfb2-4334-11e9-9d8e-c39fd8c5f431"}
