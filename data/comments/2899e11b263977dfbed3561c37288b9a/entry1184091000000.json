Maybe a better phrase is \"Paper to floss the ass\" (or just 'ass floss').\n\nAnyway's I'm just glad I haven't written my glowing 'Transformers' review yet. Now that I know you might read it I think I'll pass. :)","email":"d5dff3f4ad8eb3cd8bf83da7335bb98d","_id":"09891fd2-4334-11e9-bc28-8b39f77aeb25"}
