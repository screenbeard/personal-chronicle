With Disqus I'm automatically logged in on any site that uses it, so I can start typing my comments immediately. Now you want me to expend at least two clicks on your twitter button (assuming I'm even logged into twitter, which I'm often not)?? What kind of slavedriver are you?\n\nAlso, I like owning my comments, being notified of replies automatically and being able to reply via email. I also like being able to follow people's comments across various sites.\n\nBottom line: I'm less likely to comment on articles that don't have Disqus. Mostly because I'm lazy, but partly because I like the way its features are designed with the commenter in mind, not just the site owner.","email":"229caa711c2da4422c6186013b671da9","_id":"08bddc28-4334-11e9-aec5-93e50faea176"}
