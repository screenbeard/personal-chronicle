This could be a 4-5 hour stint. I don't gain any weight but my back is stuffed, and I think my job may be 'in part' to blame. When I get home I collapse onto the couch before moving onto chores around the house. Maybe a standing desk at home may help me.... Might be time to do some woodwork.","email":"4c039a9ca436ac7279db45082e5be9b1","_id":"08a89944-4334-11e9-a981-c7a330d5ba06"}
