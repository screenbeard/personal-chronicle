{"name":"","date":1269789000,"url":"","message":"I have a bad back.  I can't stand for too long.  I constantly switch positions when I have to sit.  However, when I've sung in choirs, I've managed to get through a performance by propping one leg at a time on a stack of books about 6 inches high.  My back is killing me at the moment, though because I'm back at work after a 2 hour shift, then a 2 hour break, and I have 3 hours to go.  So between calls, I'm going to experiment with this.  I already have the filing cabinets, and I'm extremely tired of my current computer set up.","email":"4d4e669696850708acf743aa14745847","_id":"08aa41ea-4334-11e9-8ca8-77225bcac0b5"}
