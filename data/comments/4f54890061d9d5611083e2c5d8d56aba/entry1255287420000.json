If I understand you, I must simply take it on faith that god exists or risk burning in hell. On nothing more than what? Your word? The word of a million liars or delusional people throughout the centuries? Why not Allah, why not FSM? If I cannot use the perceptions that \"god created\" for me, then what am I left with other than the particular flavour of religion I was born to? That's probably it. God wants me to burn in hell because I was born a Wesleyan Methodist Christian, not a Baptist or a Hindu.","email":"d5dff3f4ad8eb3cd8bf83da7335bb98d","_id":"0930cc88-4334-11e9-935b-07e3c46134ff"}
