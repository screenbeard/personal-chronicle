I was born a Hindu and I remained a Hindu until 2 years back where I was introduced to the concept of the God. I laughed initially but was taken aback when one of my friends said that his goal in his life is to serve God. That made me research more. I went to a conference in Indy which totally changed my heart. I used to be a pretty arrogant person but the personal relationship that you get from Him is the only proof. Actually, I am not gonna call it proof, but instead, I will call it axiom. Its the truth. I hear God's voice in the conviction that occurs in my heart. I would love to talk about it more. Peace.","email":"9988c8c45f7f26a9b3b80be05aef1290","_id":"092e97a6-4334-11e9-adec-d3e697f5bef8"}
