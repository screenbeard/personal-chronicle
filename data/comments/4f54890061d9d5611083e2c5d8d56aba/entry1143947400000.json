As I've said many times, I can't not believe in God.  &quot;The heavens tell the glory of God, and the skies announce what his hands have made.  &#65279;Day after day they tell the story; night after night they tell it again.  &#65279;They have no speech or words; they have no voice to be heard.  But their message goes out through all the world; their words go everywhere on earth.&quot;  It seems nonsense to me to claim that the impersonal created the personal, and mindlessness can create minds.  My children were not created from a chance combination of atoms, and their personalities did not come from some ever-existent cloud of dust.  The evidence for the existence of God is always around us for all to see.  To demand our own special proof is perhaps a little unreasonable, and is maybe saying to God, &quot;I will not exercise faith.  You must provide extra absolute proof just for me&quot;.  If the magnificence of creation isn't enough proof, then nothing will satisfy.   Many believers have learned faith through trials, while many harden their hearts because of trials.  Each must choose, but remember that to harden the heart is to unknowingly become harder of personality, and to lose the gentleness and love that we once had.","email":"e4f62215fa112076e37086588bcee1fb","_id":"092ee9ea-4334-11e9-876d-1f87bdd13b08"}
