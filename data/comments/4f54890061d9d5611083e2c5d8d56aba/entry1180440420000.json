I was preparing to subsume it into my other blog again.\n\nI haven't written in a while because I really haven't got much more to say. Besides being a lot more firm in my belief that I need more evidence, nothing much has changed for me. I see no reason to decide categorically that I am an atheist, as there is no shame for me in sitting on the fence any more. My wife remains a Christian, and perhaps that holds me back in part, but I really see no need to go much further than I have at the moment. Part of me even holds a tiny hope that one day God will declare Himself to me.\n\nTo both Christians and Atheists I sound wishy-washy but I'm just saying aloud what about 80% of the population live (if not think about).","email":"d5dff3f4ad8eb3cd8bf83da7335bb98d","_id":"09302e54-4334-11e9-b30e-4b77aac43287"}
