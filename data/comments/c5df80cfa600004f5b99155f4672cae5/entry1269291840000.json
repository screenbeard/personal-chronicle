While it's apparent in this day and age that relying just on ads isn't enough, it's definitely worth a try.\nFirstWaves gives you that opportunity to introduce affiliate marketting, if there's a Wave-related product you want to review that also happens to offer an affiliate program.\n\nAs for me, I'm considering taking my ads off ZombieSkittles and replacing them with a donation button similar to Rubenerd's blog. It's all about what you feel comfortable doing; that adblock you have sitting on the sidebar isn't intrusive in the least.","email":"41577a138df85c1f52eb44de1671a584","_id":"08ae94ac-4334-11e9-80e7-d73b77f5d15f"}
