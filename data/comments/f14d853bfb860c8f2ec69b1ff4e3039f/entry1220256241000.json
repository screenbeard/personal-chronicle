Being a jedi is cool and all but you have to have time to react. Superman would just hit you superfast and then the jedi would be dazed and not be able to use the force or his lightsaber... While he may win this battle Superman still looks like a dork with his undies on the outside and jedis always looks cooler with their villager-hessian cloak look. <br><br>Happy to have sorted this dilemma for you.<br><br>Welcome home amelynne. I&#39;m sure you will side with me on this one. Don&#39;t believe everything daddy says about superheroes. Obi Wan Kenobi is way cooler.","email":"8deb806f3ef4a10f29e02e0b0f1b4fa4","_id":"09965364-4334-11e9-a45d-5bbf74f58b89"}
