Enterprise web apps, what I tend to work on, concentrate less on the flashy UI and more on getting good structure into the code so the code is maintainable. Not to say that the UI isn't complex, the application we are working on at the moment has some funky GIS functionality that will be fun to work with, just not as emphasized.\n\nMy advice to people starting out in the Java web application world (and no you didn't ask :) ) is to go out and find a good framework and learn it. I would recommend either Struts 2 or Spring MVC as good places to start. Then maybe look at something a bit more cutting edge such as Grails (my favorite) or even Lift, the Scala framework.","email":"396d82e627fabb9374a2b5c84dbfeae5","_id":"0992a19c-4334-11e9-af8c-e32628dc3d3c"}
