It is all too easy to pick one of the comics that didn't hit the mark (I agree that many don't), but if you look at the link here, they can invoke a smile or chuckle from time to time.  For that reason alone, I would suggest that this isn't the WORST comic.  Not the best I agree, but not the worst either.\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.gocomics.com\/fredbasset\/2012\/03\/28","email":"dcde953ca4a0ee4f90227b28a832cced","_id":"09b4940a-4334-11e9-81c7-67c349590d3e"}
