It hurts my head.\n1. STOP YELLING\n2. Learn to spell. It's \"platinum\", not \"platimun\"\n3. Try and give your comments more context. I had no idea that Hamish and Andy regularly riff on Fred Basset comics. Without that knowledge, your comment makes even less sense.\n4. Don't be so ready to insult people who are clearly far more intelligent.\n5. Pay attention when someone says they don't care for your opinion, and not to bother leaving a comment.","email":"d5dff3f4ad8eb3cd8bf83da7335bb98d","_id":"09ab604c-4334-11e9-91c5-634910b3ac98"}
