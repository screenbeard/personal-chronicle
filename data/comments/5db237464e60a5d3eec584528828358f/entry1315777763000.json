It is a deplorable waste of space for any newspaper that would carry it. Your opinion on the matter is one of objective truth, based on common sense, common decency, and what is a reasonable depiction of trash. I felt the same way about \"Nancy,\" and despised it for years, until the creator, Ernie Bushmiller, died and was replaced by Jerry Scott. Only then was it improved, vastly, with updated, genuine humor and art style. People who appreciate \"Fred\" are equal to those who get their nourishment from a landfill and call it \"Sunday Brunch.\" Attempting to prove your point to such, is like trying to convince a one year old that he ought to read the Wall Street Journal instead of Teen Beat. Your pick for best comic is mine, as well, therefore I will employ the axiom that \"Great minds think alike.\"","email":"14ce1d571c34b0f0299fa581f38784e6","_id":"09b444e6-4334-11e9-820b-3bd5360bd5b4"}
