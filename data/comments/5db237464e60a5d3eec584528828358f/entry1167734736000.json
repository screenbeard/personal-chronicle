Now you may argue that 'The Phantom' is not funny either, and that I haven't singled it out for my scorn, but his serialised adventures are not meant to be. Fred Basset on the other hand MUST be trying to be amusing, as the dog wears a constantly smug expression, and regularly makes asides to the audience that are meant to include us in the 'joke'.<br><br>I've heard ridicule piled on the 'Family Circus', and must say that I while I haven't read many, what I have read seems to be attempting to be funny and poignant. It is also clearly written with an audience in mind (families\/parents) who might share the joke. Whether it succeeds or not is irrelevant, but the effort disguises its (lack of) humour.<br><br>Fred Basset on the other hand is neither poignant or funny, and lacks a clear audience (stupid dogs maybe - but dogs don't read the comics section, and stupid ones only read the lifestyle section).<br><br>I hope that my arguments have made you realise that I am indeed right. In any other debate I will concede I am wrong when I am given clear evidence - but of this one thing I am certain. Fred Basset is not a good comic. It is not a passable comic. Fred Basset is a dreadful blight on humanity. He is never funny.<br><br>And 'Calvin and Hobbes' IS the greatest comic strip and holds that place with Gary Larson's 'Farside' comic.","email":"d5dff3f4ad8eb3cd8bf83da7335bb98d","_id":"09a691a2-4334-11e9-b934-6726b35646ab"}
