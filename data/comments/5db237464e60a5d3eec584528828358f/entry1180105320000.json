The guy who originally made Fred Basset died around 16 years ago. for the last 14 years it's been drawn and written by someone else. I'm willing to bet that all you Fred Basset lovers are fans of the original artist and writer Alex Graham. We in Australia only get the later strips syndicated in our newspapers, the ones *written by someone else*. They are neither funny, nor charming - as evidenced by the strip above. Any given strip will not make me laugh - most don't make sense in a comic way. I could write a comic where:\n* I tie my shoelace\n* I look out of the panel and say \"Oh look... I tied my shoelace\"\nAnd I would be about on a par with current Fred Basset comics.\n\nLighten up. Don't read blogs of people who's opinions you don't care for. Not everything written on the Internet has to be argued with.\n\nFred Basset IS the dumbest comic strip ever written.","email":"d5dff3f4ad8eb3cd8bf83da7335bb98d","_id":"09a9546e-4334-11e9-989f-736b86441870"}
