{"name":"Some guy","date":1268646960,"url":"","message":"The strip is in no way subtly funny or humorous. There is no observation of every-day life that presents any level of wit to the audience. There is a snippet of every-day life,but nothing from the strip brings a level of humor that is not found in the same scene in a real setting. It simply presents a possible situation that a dog could be in and offers a brief glimpse of the event. There is no setup, punchline, or social commentary of any kind. In addition to this, many panels are traditionally wasted showing the same image or similar ones repeatedly with no text. It doesn't even have artistic merit... the drawings are simple and the so-called 'abstract' nature of it appears to be an illusion stemming from people thinking too hard about the strip's intention and claiming to be \"intellectual\". The comic is either the so simple and pointless that it has tricked millions of people into thinking that there is some humor in it that they are too stupid to understand; or the comic is simply the world's largest-scale inside joke, with everyone agreeing to pretend that it is funny.","email":"b37f6ecde29c498355bb9f53cd49565c","_id":"09aee370-4334-11e9-a557-b37c9d61ecdf"}
