I was just reading a comics page, and just seeing it there made me google \"why does anybody like fred basset?\" because I couldn't fathom what on earth could possess people to think it's funny. Perhaps people who laugh at the regular things dogs do... and extra hard if that dog might spell out exactly what it's doing, as it's doing it. But those are not people who, in my mind, should have an valid opinion on what makes something really funny.\u00a0\n\nI don't know enough comics (even though I know quite a few) to say that Fred Basset is absolutely the worst. But it's got to be a contender.\u00a0\n\n\"you say that calvin and hobbes is the best comic strip ever?\n\nerm... NO !!!\n\nhe's probably JUSt as boring as some of the bassets.\"\nWrong. The train wreck that is Fred Basset will never, nor has ever been, as funny as even the worst Calvin and Hobbes. That's kind of like saying, \"This little league player has had some swings better than some of Derek Jeter's.\"\u00a0\n\nNot that all comedy has to be smart... but you've got to draw a line somewhere. And everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but some opinions are just wrong.","email":"f6040560ee43130012aa3c6b238bef0e","_id":"09b3f1b2-4334-11e9-872c-2f53f9a9a91f"}
