I don't think so. There is always something better coming along... add to that websites and hosting aren't really lasting. Things change. Data changes. Even if we carve our name in stone or on a tree, there's nothing to suggest that stone or tree will be there for very long.\r\nI think our influence on history is based on the way we relate to people. Good or bad. The larger that influence, the longer our name continues throughout time.","email":"4c039a9ca436ac7279db45082e5be9b1","_id":"09348602-4334-11e9-99ca-b75c0e0d806a"}
