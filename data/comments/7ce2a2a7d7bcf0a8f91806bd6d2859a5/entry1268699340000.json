If you consider your consciousness as a collection of memories and 'ways of thinking' then, like the genes you physically pass on to your offspring, aspect of your personality can infect others and live on through them. Every time someone tells a joke you once told them, or remembers a shared experience, or looks at the world through a lens that you gave them, a part of you buds off and spreads. I guess it's a good incentive to lead a virtuous life.","email":"229caa711c2da4422c6186013b671da9","_id":"0938e526-4334-11e9-9f9c-77ffe3efecea"}
