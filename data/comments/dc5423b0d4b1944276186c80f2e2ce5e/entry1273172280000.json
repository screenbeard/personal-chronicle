I ended up doing the my docs redirection via GP and the Desktop and favorites via  the registry change via GP preferences.\n\nRegarding the variable discussion, ZCM 10 lets you specify variables for use in software deployment at the \"OU\" level.   It is very handy for couple applications.  For instance, I put all of the computers for one classroom in the same OU. Then I am able to specify variables for that classroom.  I specify a variable for th teacher computer name, then when I deploy my SynchronEyes  app, I am able to use variable to point the student computers to the teachers computer all with the same app.","email":"d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e","_id":"08db8232-4334-11e9-aa4b-d3e4f0b5f7cb"}
