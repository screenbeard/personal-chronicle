{"name":"Adam","date":1274698560,"url":"","message":"Josh.  This was helpful.  I'm trying to migrate a legacy folder redirection GPO based on 2003\/XP to 2008\/Win7.  The later is much more granular and allows me to leave music locally while putting documents, favorites, links and pictures on our network drive.\n\n%HOMESHARE%Documents\n%HOMESHARE%Desktop\n%HOMESHARE%Favorites\n%HOMESHARE%Links\n\nall work well, redirecting the test folders to the test user's W drive root.\n\nHowever:\n\n%HOMESHARE%Pictures exhibits the same behavior as the other setting of \"Follow the Documents\" directory.  It's as if the ghost of XP is still alive and requires My Pictures to be a sub of My Documents.  It's not super critical, but I'm curious if you've had any luck putting Pictures at the same level as documents in a redirected policy?\n\nThanks for the excellent writeup.","email":"0dca22aec201db2a9235aa8dc25ef11c","_id":"08dbc94a-4334-11e9-8dbe-4fa8982bc479"}
