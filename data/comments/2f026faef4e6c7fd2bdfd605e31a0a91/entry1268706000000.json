And while all the robots etc are somewhat limited at the moment, it's easy to imagine bots and gadgets that help integrate all sorts of other comminucation into Wave - for those of use who want that.\n\nAs for the horizontal communication, I suspect that Google are working on that. The recent API update has shown that this is where it's all headed eventually. It's just baby steps all the way. And people forget that this is the way Google works. None of their most successful products started out the powerhouses they are today, they grew slowly over time. The same philosophy applies doubly to Wave.\n\nThanks for your insights. I appreciate you taking the time to comment!","email":"754cf072d8d20240020e1bd6c8b2be7c","_id":"098e47aa-4334-11e9-be38-37974ee3fa02"}
