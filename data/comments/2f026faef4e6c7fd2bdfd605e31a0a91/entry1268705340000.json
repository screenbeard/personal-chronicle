The flip-side is that Wave has to bring something useful to sites that try to make themselves visible on it.\n\nThe main problem I see with the platform is that it is too cartesian: it's a simple framework of waves and blips and whatnots, and either you're an extension in which case you live entirely within a blip or you're a robot in which case you're entirely within a wave. There's not enough horizontal communication to blur between the two modes of operation.","email":"352b89a7b08d1e020afd2794111e6764","_id":"098decd8-4334-11e9-85ff-d7a86422c3d5"}
