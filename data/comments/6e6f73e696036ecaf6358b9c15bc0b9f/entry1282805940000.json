Client log-in times are near 5 minutes depending on the number of printers involved.  Despite following your directions though, my printers will not deploy unless loopback is enabled.\n\nMy setup:\nComputers in an OU\nGroup Policy Object linked to that OU that has the printers added in the preferences section.  One of them is set to be default.  All of the printers are targeted to that OU and set to run in the user's security context.  Loopback is disabled but the printers do not install.\n\nAny thoughts?","email":"553f78d6dc74cb613df9ae71e73c663c","_id":"08cb2504-4334-11e9-8b97-93919ffbe1a3"}
