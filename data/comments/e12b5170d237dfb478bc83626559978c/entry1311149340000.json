David Hawkins from over at whatculture.com here.\nFirst off thank you for taking the time to read my brain-blah on Marvel Digital Comics. And for the wonderful comment. More importantly I want to thank you for one hell of a comparative review between Marvel and Comixology!!! I am really quite new to doing anything online... I steadfastly fight the Facebook and Twitter influence of those around me, rejoice in the world of tactile sensation. But your great post has got me interested and as soon as I get myself some spare cash I am going to check out the Comixology app. As a fellow Image fan (I am soooooo bummed that Astounding Wolfman was wrapped up at issue #25) it is very tempting to still be able to get a taste of the great stories they create, and I do occasionally like to drop in and see what is happening in the DC world.\nI look forward to reading more of your blogs mate.\nGreat job!","email":"9203b55f6b565e4da127fd3c3addde5e","_id":"08c3a888-4334-11e9-882a-e78e62aa37e0"}
