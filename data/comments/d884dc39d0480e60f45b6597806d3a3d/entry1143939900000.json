I believe, (have faith), that God is there.  There is too much incredible complexity in creation and too much information in even the smallest life-forms on even the cellular level to believe otherwise.  You can give this intelligence any name you choose, but he is still the Creator.  I also believe that if you are as honest as you (and I), believe you are, then you will eventually come to a true knowledge of Him.  I would suggest though that the heart of man is pretty dishonest and will look for reasons to disbelieve if he feels cheated by God, is afraid of God, or is angry at God.  Be honestly sure of your own motives.","email":"e4f62215fa112076e37086588bcee1fb","_id":"08d03d14-4334-11e9-9fd8-c3b068526713"}
