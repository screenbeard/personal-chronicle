But if you walk down the beach and you see \"John Loves Mary\" and a big heart around it and an arrow through it, you wouldn't think the waves produced it. It's information with content. The biological information of a living organism is biological information. Nature can't produce that. It takes intelligence to produce information. Whenever we see a novel or a cave painting or data on a computer, we know there's an intelligence behind it. When we look at the four-letter chemical alphabet of DNA and how it spells out the precise assembly instructions for every protein out of which our body is built, to me that points in the direction of an intelligence behind it. It isn't just complexity.\"There is no end to the theories of those that want to put God out of their thinking.  Theories like yours can be in my opinion cop-outs.  For those that want to ignore the fact that the universe we live in is too fabulously complex for life to have evolved, and perfectly balanced for complex life forms such as man, there are many new theories about multiple universes etc.  These and countless other new theories are able to be thought up.  There is a veritable endless smorgasboard of ideas to enable us to avoid what our common sense and conscience tells us - that God is there.","email":"e4f62215fa112076e37086588bcee1fb","_id":"08d13034-4334-11e9-bc26-1302077700f0"}
