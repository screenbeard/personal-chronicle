With Google I\/O coming up, they're on a new feature spree at the moment, and it's only going to get better. There are probably a couple of posts I could write about why now is a great time to get back into Wave. The Wave Watchers (a group of wave enthusiasts and developers) are putting together a comprehensive post of this nature as we speak! \n\nAs for your security concerns, I think it's right to be somewhat wary. It's new technology and a new idea, and it may very well have fundamental flaws in the way it's currently implemented. It is however, only a \"preview\" still, and anyone using it for top-secret sensitive data does so at their own risk. The way to minimise your risk is to not use gadgets that have not been thoroughly vetted (the source is always easily available) or not use them at all, and only invite users that you trust.
