In the end I decided that I probably wouldn't use Google's implementation of the Wave protocol due to the problem you mentioned at the end of this post: Wave abuse.\n\nI think that fundamentally the Wave protocol has a security \"issue\". Not a bug, not necessarily a flaw, but it has several things that make me uncomfortable with it. I wrote more about it on my research blag: http:\/\/www.tobiaslabs.com\/59\/some-security-issues-with-google-wave\/\n\nI link to a support forum where a person argued that the \"Remove\" function of the Wave protocol may not even \"make sense\", but I think Google's implementation on this is pretty reasonable. I think I'll start using Google Wave again to see how I like the recent changes.","email":"26776100d2a99e3985945eed5689addc","_id":"0955e4b4-4334-11e9-8a08-2375ff82d2fc"}
