The main reason for this blog is so I can add your name in as administrator to any ICT blog that might occur at Glenelg School. I'm trying to provide the scaffolding for whole site adoption (if they want) of online collaborative learning. I will help create the blogs for everyone. possibily once the kids know every class has it's own blog then a snowball effect might begin to happen.\nCheers, Al","email":"03b1f7c037811bb581a990f3a7fd8d22","_id":"08afa324-4334-11e9-8c6f-f3a8db47ed32"}
