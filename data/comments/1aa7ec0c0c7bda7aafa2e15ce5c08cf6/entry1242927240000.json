Every site has to be specifically added to this list. I bet in less than a minute I could find a site that wasn't blocked that should be, and any kid with two minutes to spare and Google could find it. 'But it's OK, cause out internet is \"protected\"' will be the parent's cry. And the false positives and potential abuse make this a BAD THING for the sake of a few kids who's parents don't care enough about them to parent properly. Why should I be stuck with a slower, incomplete internet because Joe Douchebag can't be buggered looking after his kids? If he lets his kids play on the street, should I have to find a different street to drive down?","email":"d5dff3f4ad8eb3cd8bf83da7335bb98d","_id":"09a1cd84-4334-11e9-9fa1-8b8446e18853"}
