Or give our teachers resources to get skilled in internet technology to better teach our kids about \"cyber safety\"\n\n@jon_seymour I totally agree. My bastion of sanity from a filtered connection at work is to return to a pure internet at home. I am so looking forward to teaching Amelynne the joys of Twitter (blocked at school), Flickr (was blocked), YouTube (blocked) et al. At least (I thought) we could explore them at home without problem. It's an aside, and one I'm not willing to go into in great detail here, but I'm of the oppinion that schools should be a lot more open with the internet too. How else will kids learn to keep safe if they can't use them in a \"monitored\" environment? Kids get very little education about this stuff, and then get home and get into trouble uploading stuff onto YouTube, because their parents \"can't keep up with this computer stuff\" and teachers can't teach them how to use it responsibly (please don't think that I mean teachers should be doing the parenting&mdash;it's just messed up all round really)\n\n@zoon Thanks for the heads up. I'm hoping your friend isn't actually a technical person and was just wowed by all the fancy words and figures being thrown about. No technical mind I know thinks it's even remotely possible to balance \"bulletproof filtering\" with a \"reliable useful internet\".","email":"d5dff3f4ad8eb3cd8bf83da7335bb98d","_id":"09a1278a-4334-11e9-99ec-974d4a5b47f6"}
