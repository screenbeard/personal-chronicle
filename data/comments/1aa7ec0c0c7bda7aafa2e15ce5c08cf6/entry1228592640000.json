I am not arguing that schools shouldn't have filtering, but it makes it even more important, in my view, that homes do not have it - children have to know that it is possible to live responsibly with an unfiltered connection and their parents have to provide the example.\n\nIf childrens only experience of the Internet is via censored connections, the next generation of adults won't think twice about the Government controlling everything they read and hear. We need unfiltered connections precisely to provide a working example to children of the value of unfiltered connections.\n\nThis has to be a powerful argument against mandatory ISP filtering in the home, I think.","email":"0ace258306787dcff1e1da1a04304115","_id":"09a03ec4-4334-11e9-91cb-6ffc7dc91acb"}
