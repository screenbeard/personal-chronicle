Ctrl-Alt-Del is aimed toward and written by a gamer. I like it because of the ongoing story. I like Dr. McNinja because ninjas are cool, and a ninja who's a doctor is cooler still. The first xkcd I read must have been just right 'cause I started from the beginning and read them all. When you start you wonder if you're missing something because the drawing is so simple and almost crude, but as you read you realise that its simplicity is what makes it so charming. The author is also incredibly smart.\n\nSo no, it's not you - but you might have to give it some time to appreciate any of them.\n\nI also have to add <a href=\"http:\/\/www.qwantz.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dinosaur Comics<\/a> to the list. Again - it takes a bit to get used to it, but over time it becomes better and better.","email":"d5dff3f4ad8eb3cd8bf83da7335bb98d","_id":"090d3f52-4334-11e9-891f-7f9a444e3149"}
