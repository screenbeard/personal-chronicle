I guess the problem is, there's pressure to market it as \"like\" something, or to explain it in real-world terms, when there really isn't anything like it at all. You or I can pick it up and run with it, but how do you teach something completely new to people who learn by pinning concepts to things they know well?","email":"754cf072d8d20240020e1bd6c8b2be7c","_id":"08e00b2c-4334-11e9-bb99-4b432956505e"}
