I think email caught on because it was as simple as sending a message to a person. The most you had to get was the concept of email addresses (for basic messages at least). Google Wave still has that basic functionality, but bombards the user with \"it's email! It's a wiki! IT'S REALTIME!\", when most basic users don't need all that (at least in their minds).\n\nDo yo know any developers who can make a version of Wave that makes sense?","email":"754cf072d8d20240020e1bd6c8b2be7c","_id":"08df2022-4334-11e9-b7b9-93b4d6b07746"}
