{"name":"Martin Vrabel","date":1196092740,"url":"","message":"Hi Josh,  thank you for such a detailed review on Taskee.   I reply to some areas of your review: opet button - style and position. We will probably  include more open button styles or possibility to edit it in near future. Moving a positions wasn`t that perfect but I hope it won`t take any problems in new version. feedback mode - this is a feature we won`t have in new version. It wasn`t used that much as we supposed. admin area - this also will be changed in new version of Taskee. It will be much simple. There will be a general Taskee account for user who will attend a project by inviting him there by another user. data on <a href=\"http:\/\/taskee.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">taskee.com<\/a> - there is just one Taskee - on our server. More people asked if its possible to make it as an application which is installed but it doesn`t fit with the Taskee philosophy. This should`t be an web 2.0 application which is exectuted from one place. But we may solve the people fears with more security of new version.  Yes as you mentioned - Taskee is in beta version so it still has a few bugs and needs little more time to &#039;grown&#039; and be ready working on 100%. That`s why we after analyzing user feedback designed a new version where most of the problems of current version are fixed. New Taskee also comes with the new design and working with it will be very very simple.
