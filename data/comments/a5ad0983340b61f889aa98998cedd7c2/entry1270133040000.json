I've embedded a facsimile of a wave into this post so people who haven't got Wave can see kinda how it works. They hit \"reply\" and leave a message - but it leaves the message as me. It uses a bot called Mr-Ray. Of course anyone without a wave account misses all the other cool features that Wave has, but it's a reasonable way to introduce people who've never used it.","email":"754cf072d8d20240020e1bd6c8b2be7c","_id":"0914cd6c-4334-11e9-8f83-3f262b70e98e"}
