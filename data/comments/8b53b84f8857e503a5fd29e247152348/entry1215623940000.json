Btw, you can access Gmail more securely using <a href=\"https:\/\/gmail.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:\/\/gmail.com<\/a> instead of <a href=\"http:\/\/gmail.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/gmail.com<\/a>.  I would highly recommend doing this, and if you ever use public wifi, make it a habit because otherwise people can copy your cookies and get access to your gmail account (I&#039;ve done it to myself, its surprisingly easy.)","email":"58c08f5f1770b6f2e3af438f31ecc22f","_id":"0961347c-4334-11e9-bc36-178d4ec7e946"}
