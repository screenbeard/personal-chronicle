I&#039;ve changed the document they were both pointing too, as the other one was throwing errors (maybe it was sending the wrong meta info), and it seems to be working again. It&#039;s also got the same zoom issues it did before that Vuzit seems to have sorted. <br \/><br \/> I get the impression that the PDFmenot guys threw it together in a weekend and put it online, but have no real future plans for it (I could be wrong of course), whereas you Vuzit guys have a big model for your product. There are so many competitors in this market though, with Scribd.com being your biggest rival I&#039;d imagine. they essentially provide the smae service, but I&#039;d argue that iPaper is a huge deal, and puts them at an advantage over your viewer. Sorry, it seems like I&#039;m picking on you guys a bit, but I&#039;m curious about your plans to keep up with the big guns.  Does Google entering this space (slowly but surely) worry you at all? <br \/><br \/> One way you could differentiate is the privacy concerns of these tools. I&#039;m currently looking at implementing a PDF viewer into a school webpage, and the documents I wish to share shouldn&#039;t necessarily be promoted &quot;socially&quot; on a site like scribd. How could Vuzit help me keep my documents under my control on my own site, but more useful to my visitors (search, full page viewing, faster etc)?  <br \/><br \/> Thank you for responding to my original post - it was a throwaway post I wrote very quickly  and with my initial first impressions. I hope you don&#039;t regret me voicing my additional concerns.","email":"d5dff3f4ad8eb3cd8bf83da7335bb98d","_id":"09489912-4334-11e9-ae9d-ffa6339c3d45"}
