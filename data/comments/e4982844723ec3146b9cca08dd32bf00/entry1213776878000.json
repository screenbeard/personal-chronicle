As you pointed out, we have focused heavily on developers first, and our user tools will be coming in the near future. <br \/><br \/> Please let us know if you have any additional questions about Vuzit, and we will be happy to help you.  Best, -Chris","email":"d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e","_id":"094847c8-4334-11e9-ad7f-fbac8b34ff8e"}
