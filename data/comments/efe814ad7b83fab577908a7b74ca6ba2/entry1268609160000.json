Or maybe I'm similar to you because most of my things never get a reply? With blogs I tend to notice most people don't comment unless there are repaying the fact you commented on their blog, or if it's a question, or something they have an opinion on. Even if they liked\/loved the post and clicked the link, they may not mention or comment, why? Because it's easy not to?\nYour blog is supposed to be about you, I don't think you need to write a post directly for your audience unless its your firstwaves site, this site should be what you wanna share? Posts like your previous ones about deciding to standing up, or about wifey and bubba. I'd rather read your views about geeky stuff rather than you just posting about it, as that's why I read YOUR blog, and why I read your twitter.
