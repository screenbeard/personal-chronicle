I love reading and replying to comments :) I rarely take the initiative to make my own, but I have been trying to be more outgoing conversation wise &gt;_&gt;\n\nI think another problem is I often have nothing to add that's really of any use, and I'm afraid if I do comment on something it'll come accross as retarded and useless.
