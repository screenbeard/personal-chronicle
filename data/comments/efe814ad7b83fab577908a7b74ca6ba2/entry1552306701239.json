Things are getting a bit outdated... and Google just updated their algorithm again, you know how that'll impact your most important traffic source, if there isn't a consistent flow of fresh articles! You see, businesses get majority of their free traffic from their blogs, and I feel that you could use a little boost, since you are not blogging constantly yet.\r\n\r\nCreating content takes a lot of time, and we have just the team from the United States/Canada to come up with great content you are looking for.\r\n\r\nYou can have your new blog to post on your website starting at $10 in as little as 5 business days!\r\n\r\nCheck out our work and reviews  here: http://bit.ly/2U158Vp\r\n\r\nYou're always covered by the industry leading 60-Day Money Back Guarantee!\r\n\r\nThanks for your time,\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\nLucie\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this message because the contact form at geekorium.com.au is open to the public.
