I suspect there is a divide between those that see the internet as a way to comment freely and without consequence, and those of us who understand that to comment with integrity you should leave your name, thereby removing that extra layer of anonymity as it were. I think the net is \"safe\" to voice ideas, as long as you understand that people might yell at you, but that they're probably just wankers.\n\nOn the Geekorium though you're opoen to say what you like. If I have a problem with it, I promise I won't yell - your comment might just mysteriously disappear though.\n\nCheck out my <a href=\"http:\/\/nunnone.com\/rules\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Site Rules<\/a> if you wanna know my commenting policy.","email":"d5dff3f4ad8eb3cd8bf83da7335bb98d","_id":"0907d396-4334-11e9-b3ee-af1ac1bd5523"}
