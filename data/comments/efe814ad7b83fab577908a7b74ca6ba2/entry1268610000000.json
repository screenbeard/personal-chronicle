I get comments from friends and people I know, but rarely anything critiquing or giving me something to work from. I also have the one or two weird posts that seem to get more attention than others, for completely unknown reasons too.\n\nAs for your writing, I enjoy reading posts like this. I'm not a programmer, or exceptionally computer literate, which is why posts like your Java Class series doesn't appeal to me. This is the same with similar posts on Rubenerd's blog, and other things. While I won't read them though, others obviously would find the information interesting.\n\nI like the idea of writing for myself, and do it most of the time, or for someone in particular. But I'll often ask questions to try and get a response, like you've effectively done here. Asking a question at the end can motivate people to provide the feedback you want\/need, and can get conversation flowing which can in effect enhances your post\/article.\n\nJust some random thoughts :)","email":"41577a138df85c1f52eb44de1671a584","_id":"0903c954-4334-11e9-b839-1f4520daa903"}
