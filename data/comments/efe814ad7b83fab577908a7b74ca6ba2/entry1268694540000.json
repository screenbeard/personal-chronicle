If people notice you, you'll get instant attention and traffic. But a typical tweet only lasts a few minutes before it's obsolete. If you have something important you want to link to you either have to choose the right time of day to tweet it or, as most people tend to, post it several times over several hours (with a 'in case you missed this...' prepend).\n\nThe other problem is people have become too comfortable with 140 character soundbites. Reading a blog with actual paragraphs is an effort in these decadent days. That's why I chose tumblr for my blog. If there's anything I want to say with more permanence and characters than twitter or facebook gives me, I'll put it up there (and then tweet it... a few times).\n\nOh yeah, about comments: I don't know about anyone else but I'm so god damned lazy I often can't even be bothered to leave a comment somewhere because I have to type in my name and email first. That's why I love Disqus.\n\nI don't know if I actually made a point of any kind with all that. If I were to offer any advice I'd say keep actively seeking out and engaging your audience. Too many people write stuff and link to it without a call to action.","email":"229caa711c2da4422c6186013b671da9","_id":"0908ca94-4334-11e9-b2a7-630336685d6f"}
