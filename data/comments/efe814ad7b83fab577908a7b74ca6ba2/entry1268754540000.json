I have nothing against that, but I do unfollow those accounts because I've learned I prefer people tweeting normally. Factual stuff is fine, but in their own style. If they post stuff I'm interested in, I'll click it.\n\nCOME BACK TO TWITTER D:","email":"41577a138df85c1f52eb44de1671a584","_id":"090a7f2e-4334-11e9-bfea-8f9ee433cca7"}
