Is this the start of a whole new arc, or another fun \"break from the norm\"?\r\n\r\nAlso I noticed some grammar mistakes: In the third paragraph it should read \"an island\", and in the sixth it should be \"remaining men\".\r\nActually, now I think of it, maybe Mr. Nunn is trying to slip in a little ARG fun in his story. the letter added was a D, and the letter missing is an N. DN? Devious Nippal?\r\n\r\n&gt;_&gt;","email":"41577a138df85c1f52eb44de1671a584","_id":"0977e622-4334-11e9-b36a-4b5f0996977a"}
