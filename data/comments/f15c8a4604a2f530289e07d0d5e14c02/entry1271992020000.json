I mean, It's like me having two blogs but having the second purely for the purpose of reposting the same articles. Why?\n\nAnd recommended buzzes seem to be cluttering my feed more and more. It's quite annoying. My only other qualm so far is the fact that things I share on Reader are instantly fed through Buzz. I mean thats cool, but once again if my followers read what I share on Reader, I doubt they want to see the same crap from me AGAIN.","email":"41577a138df85c1f52eb44de1671a584","_id":"08eae95c-4334-11e9-9aa3-13c8f9e970f6"}
