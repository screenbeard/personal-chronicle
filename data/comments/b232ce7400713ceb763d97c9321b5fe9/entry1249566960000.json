You would be able to use the variable named voice with any dog() or any extension of  dog(), like goldenRetriever.\n\nI would suggest checking out these sites for additional info:\nhttp:\/\/java.sun.com\/docs\/books\/tutorial\/\nhttp:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/tagged\/java","email":"2b7bac198b8d719b486d570bb8d5173b","_id":"09177a08-4334-11e9-a891-b70fdf94ed15"}
