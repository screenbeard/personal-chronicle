Until then , think of it like this:\n\nA getter in Java is a way for one object (goldenRetriever) to \"get\" data(voice) from another object(dog).\n\nA setter in Java is a way for an object(goldenRetriever) to \"set\" data(voice) as it's own.\n\nIt is really a lot of typing for a simple idea. That is one of the chief complaints about Java. There is a lot of \"keyboard noise\" to produce a small result.","email":"2b7bac198b8d719b486d570bb8d5173b","_id":"091a1ba0-4334-11e9-ad42-27216aa6c478"}
