If you have the bucks for a book I would recommend Refactoring by Martin Fowler. It shows you OO by showing what bad code is like and how to fix it. It is a book that will stand you in good stead in your professional career as well as at school.","email":"396d82e627fabb9374a2b5c84dbfeae5","_id":"0917e20e-4334-11e9-a79f-b3024254f84d"}
