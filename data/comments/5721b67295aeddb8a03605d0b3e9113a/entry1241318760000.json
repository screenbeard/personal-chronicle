A member of that message board made the port to SDL format by heavily modifying the Wolfenstein source code, which I would not be surprised if it was borrowed to be used as the base for the iPhone version; the SDL version is made to work with not only Vista, but can be adapted for anything; even a console like Dreamcast.\n\nIt's a great game, and I have so many memories of it, it's amazing.","email":"41577a138df85c1f52eb44de1671a584","_id":"09b79808-4334-11e9-8d16-ef653e3d1ec2"}
