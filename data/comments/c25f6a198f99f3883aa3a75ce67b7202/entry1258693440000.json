I notice this was written 3 year ago, and wonder how your thinking and experience has evolved since then.\r\n\r\nI left the Christian faith myself because of the \"problem of communication.\"  If God is all-powerful and loves individual people, why does he not make himself more clear?  It was my observation that the most devoted and the most sincere Christians could not agree on some very essential questions of how we are to be saved and how we are to live our lives.  For many years I laid the blame on myself and on my fellow Christians, that we hadn't learned enough, that we were too often blinded by sin, that I needed to find a better church.  Eventually, though, it made more sense to decide that a loving, personal God just wasn't there.  I know many (all?) Christians who read your story will blame you for somehow not trying hard enough or not trusting enough, but I understand.  \r\n\r\nThank you for writing your story.  You and your wife are in my thoughts.\r\n\r\nLisa\r\naka Peridot","email":"ccfa07366b9f9ce30b5b5ea49bafab9f","_id":"0985006e-4334-11e9-a8ca-6b9f18b3a891"}
