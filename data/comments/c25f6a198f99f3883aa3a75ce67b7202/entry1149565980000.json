(shortened very simplafied version) this is faith. as he went on i became aggitated and i had to ask well if salvation is relationship and God wants all to be saved were is God in your situation (no names used annonimity was yours) he gave varied responces  like God is there perhaps you  miss his voice, he went on to sugest that i find out how you and you wifes relationship works as this will be an indicator as to how God will engage you we are all engaged by God in our own laguage. the final point he made is this  (most christians will see you as lost off track in some way) but he feels that you are in a good place you dont want ritual you want relationship this for him is positive not negitive. i want to say that i know God is there (in my time when i wanted to give up i knew i had to turn my back and walk away from the truth cuse i wanted to sleep with that girl with the brown legs). God is there in you life keep watch for him listen for his voice i know he calls you i pray that he would break into your life in power show himself but dont you miss him. pass my regards to you wife and i hope to see you  soon","email":"613f9e641e781d7cffab92aa3bcccb02","_id":"0984324c-4334-11e9-aa0b-07e58cce8c12"}
