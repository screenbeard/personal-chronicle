As I understand you, you are saying something like 'If God is there, and He is as loving and caring as some profess Him to be, then it should be more evident to us.  If He is truly loving, why does He hide Himself from those that desire a more intimate relationship with Him?  Why is He so distant etc...?'  There is one thing though:  In the analogy, you omit to say that around this person who is receiving these letters from this woman are many evidences of her existence.  As he walks along the street there are trees that have been planted by her, gardens created in infinite beauty by her.  Even the sky is a result of her creativity, etc...  Of course the analogy fails because no woman can do such things, and therefore the evidence that is pointed to by the scriptures to the existence of God cannot be included in your story.  If God is a figment, you have still to explain the existence of an incredibly complex universe, and the explanations put forward by evolutionists are weakening more and more as more information is found about life in all of its intricacy.","email":"e4f62215fa112076e37086588bcee1fb","_id":"0983cf78-4334-11e9-bce9-13613058ad85"}
