There is about 500 websites from Australia alone with people who are looking for the movie.  Maybe if you posted the contact details on the web somewhere or set up an online petition we can get them to sign on too and put some pressure on the company.\n\nWe got a copy of the movie in the early naughties from Village Roadshow as my Dad worked there.  They said at the time that no one wanted to see the movie so they were just going to give it away or throw it in the bin!!!! We've watched the movie on average about 10 times a year since then.","email":"26081d737dc59ad7aa1de2743a6a45a9","_id":"08f8667c-4334-11e9-b0c9-0778f9e9e174"}
