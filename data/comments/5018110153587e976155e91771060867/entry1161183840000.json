I first saw this movie around ten years ago, when it screened on SKY Movies for a month, and it is one of my all-time favourites.  Hopefully when the DVD is finally released it won't be too hard for us NZ fans to get hold of.  Awesome idea to write to the filmakers by the way, it'll be interesting to see where this goes!","email":"5e1b577aa55b310424fe422d1cb0acf3","_id":"08f96a0e-4334-11e9-bc6e-4352bca01d79"}
