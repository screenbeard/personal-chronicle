After becoming separated from my Dad, she has spent the majority of her time working and studying so that she can keep a roof over the 5 other people that live in the house.\nI have never seen her not working or studying, and it is amazing that she is so resilient in supporting herself and everyone. While she doesn't do it alone, her sheer willpower even in the face of defeat come Uni Exam time amazes me and is something I'll never be able to match.\nIt is an amazing sacrifice.\n\nI'd go on but it's 4am and I need to move onto disc two of this Buffy marathon.","email":"41577a138df85c1f52eb44de1671a584","_id":"093fe312-4334-11e9-b3bd-1f0aa90f7af0"}
